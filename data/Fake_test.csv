FLASHBACK: KING OBAMA COMMUTES SENTENCES OF 22 DRUG DEALERS,"Just making room for Hillary President Obama today announced his decision to commute the sentences of 22 convicted drug offenders   many of them serving time after being convicted of conspiracy to distribute either cocaine, heroin, marijuana or methamphetamine. The 22 commutations granted today underscore the President s commitment to using all the tools at his disposal to bring greater fairness and equity to our justice system,  White House Assistant and Counsel to the President Neil Eggleston in a statement on the White House Website.  Further, they demonstrate how exercising this important authority can remedy imbalances and rectify errors in sentencing. In a letter to one of the pardoned criminals   Terry Barnes of Mississippi   Obama explained that he was granting him a commutation to allow him to turn his life around. It embodies the basic belief in our democracy that people deserve a second chance after having made a mistake in their lives that led to a conviction under our laws,  he wrote, acknowledging that some were skeptical about his ability to change. I believe in your ability to prove the doubters wrong,  Obama concluded.  So good luck, and Godspeed. Obama s action is part of his continued effort to highlight the harsh penalties for non-violent drug offenders and encourage reform.Full list below:  Terry Andre Barnes   East Moline, ILOffense: Conspiracy to distribute cocaine base; supervised release violation (distribution of cocaine base) (Southern District of Iowa)Sentence: 246 months  imprisonment; 10 years  supervised release (July 25, 2005)Commutation Grant: Prison sentence commuted to expire on July 28, 2015.

APPLE’S CEO SAYS RELIGIOUS FREEDOM LAWS ARE ‘DANGEROUS’ TO GAYS But Sells Products In Countries Where Gays Are Thrown Off Rooftops,"The gay mafia has a new corporate  Don. This is the only article you will need to read about the sheer stupidity of left-wing agitators who are crowing about the new religious freedom law in Indiana.Yesterday, Apple CEO Tim Cook, himself a gay man, published an op-ed in The Washington Post with this ominous title:  Pro-discrimination laws are dangerous.  Cook argues that religious freedom laws, like the one signed by Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana last week are  dangerous  to gay people.A debatable point. However, what is not debatable is this: laws that make homosexuality punishable by death are dangerous to gay people.That s why you might be surprised to learn that Cook s company, Apple, does business in four (4) countries that make homosexuality a capital crime. Those countries are Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Nigeria, and Qatar.If you zip on over to this page, you can see the list of all of the countries where Apple does business. Those four countries are on the list.We anxiously await CNN s Andrew Cuomo or ABC s George Stephanopoulos to ask Tim Cook to appear on air and explain this glaring inconsistency, which should be obvious even to the average MSNBC viewer.However, we all know that won t happen.Via: DownTrend",politics,31-Mar-15
"WATCH DIRTY HARRY REID ON HIS LIE ABOUT ROMNEY’S TAXES: “HE DIDN’T WIN, DID HE?”","In case you missed it Sen. Harry Reid (R-NV), who announced last week that he will retire after his current term expires in early 2017, said he does not regret taking to the Senate floor in 2012 to accuse then-GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney of not paying his taxes. No, I don t regret that at all,  he told CNN s Dana Bash.  The Koch brothers   no one would help me. They were afraid the Koch brothers would go after them, so I did it on my own. Bash said some viewed the charge as  McCarthy-ite,  but Reid didn t buy that explanation. He shrugged, saying,  they can call it whatever they want. Romney didn t win, did he?  Reid said somewhat amusingly.",politics,31-Mar-15
OH NO! GUESS WHO FUNDED THE SHRINE TO TED KENNEDY,"Nothing like political cronyism to make your stomach churn. Especially since it s for a scumbag like Teddy who rode the coattails of the American taxpayers his entire life. Could they not raise the funds from private donors? I guess not it s a shame for all the hardworking taxpayers out there who ponied up without even having a choice in the matter.Over half of the funding for the Edward M. Kennedy Institute for the United States Senate came from taxpayer dollars, half of that from Defense budget.It was supposed to be all private money but alas even in death Teddy Kennedy has found a way to take from the American taxpayer. That the money is going to his own self aggrandizement would have pleased him. That the money came from  defense  would have pleased him even more.The New York Times writes:  Here s an unstated lesson: It pays to have friends running the Appropriations Committee. More than $18 million of the $38 million in public funds for the center was funneled through the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, a powerful panel once run by other Senate powerhouses who have died in recent years:Senators Daniel K. Inouye, Democrat of Hawaii, and Ted Stevens, Republican of Alaska  But one would think people would be lining up to throw cash at the project given how great Kennedy was. Couldn t the Kennedy clan pony up the dough? Or maybe just house the memorial in the basement of the Hyannis Port estate? But why have the family or friends of the Kennedys pay for Teddy s monument when one can get the taxpayers to do it?and this from Newsmax:  President Obama, Vice President Biden, Secretary of State John Kerry and Sen. Elizabeth Warren will all gather to praise the Edward M. Kennedy Institute for the United States Senate. Much will be said about Kennedy s 46-year record in the U.S. Senate, nothing about various scandals that ranged from Chappaquiddick to his attempts to have the Soviets intervene in the 1984 presidential election against Ronald Reagan. Boston Herald columnist Howie Carr points out that the Insititute  was supposed to be paid for exclusively with private donations.  But it should come as no surprise that the gorgeous 40,000-square-foot building that will house Kennedy s papers and memorabilia as well as a recreation of his personal office and the Senate chamber was financed with a generous $38 million congressional earmark. The state of Massachusetts chipped in with another $5 million for education  infrastructure.Read more: Newsmax",politics,31-Mar-15
BENGHAZI PANEL CALLS HILLARY TO TESTIFY UNDER OATH AS WHITE HOUSE ASKS FOR MORE TIME TO “REVIEW” (DELETE) HER E-MAILS,"Does anyone really think Hillary Clinton will come clean about ANYTHING? She dug herself such a huge hole that I could see her digging an even deeper one to get herself in the clear. She s going to lie you know it.Gowdy had this to say today about the possibility of retrieving some of Hillary s e-mails:House Select Committee on Benghazi Chairman Trey Gowdy said Tuesday it may still be  technically possible  to retrieve thousands of emails to and from former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on the private server her lawyer said was  wiped clean. BENGHAZI PANEL CALLS HILLARY TO TESTIFYA House panel Tuesday formally requested Hillary Clinton to testify about the private server and email account she used while serving as secretary of state.Rep. Trey Gowdy, chairman of the Select Committee on Benghazi, sent a request to Clinton s personal attorney, David E. Kendall, requesting that Clinton appear before the committee no later than May 1 for a transcribed interview about the server and email.The request comes after Kendall told Gowdy that the server had been wiped clean and that it would be impossible to recover the 30,000 emails Clinton deleted last year.Gowdy, in his request to Kendall, also asked Clinton to  reconsider  her refusal to turn over the server to a neutral third party, which he called  highly unusual, if not unprecedented. Clinton said she only deleted personal emails and turned over every work-related message to the State Department, which is reviewing the data to filter out classified information. Because of the Secretary s unique arrangement with herself as it relates to public records during and after her tenure as Secretary of State.  Gowdy wrote,  this Committee is left with no alternative but to request Secretary Clinton appear before this Committee for a transcribed interview to better understand decisions the Secretary made relevant to the creation, maintenance, retention, and ultimately deletion of public records. WHAT S THERE TO REVIEW???As you read the following media report it is important to remember:   Hillary Clinton has previously stated, unequivocally, that no classified communication traveled through her self-created personal communication network.So what exactly is there to review? Either the U.S. government believes the statements by the Secretary of State to be true, or they do not.Second,   the government knowingly allowed the secret communication network to exist and allowed all the construction issues therein to take place. Therefore the burden of any administrative compliance issue should reside upon them to reconcile expeditiously.The Obama administration told a federal court Monday that it needs  several months  more to go through former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton s government emails, saying it s proving time-consuming to sort out exactly what information they can release to the public,Justice Department lawyers also bristled at accusations that the government perpetrated a fraud by hiding the existence of the emails, as Mr. Obama s team begins to fully grapple with the legal complications Mrs. Clinton has left them.Read more: Washington Examiner ",politics,31-Mar-15
HILLARY RODHAM NIXON: A CANDIDATE WITH MORE BAGGAGE THAN A SAMSONITE FACTORY,"The irony here isn t lost on us. Hillary is being compared to the President she wanted to take down. Nixon s got nothing on this criminal who wiped her server clean after e-mails were requested from her. John Fund questions the Democrat s strategy  to support a Nixonian type candidate with more baggage than a Samsonite factory She s secretive, scandal-plagued, and seemingly inevitable. Ever since Hillary Clinton s e-mail scandal broke, comparisons between her secretive style and that of Richard Nixon, whom she ironically pursued as a young lawyer on the House impeachment committee, have been frequent. But with the revelation that she wiped her private e-mail server clean after her records were requested by the State Department last year, the comparisons are becoming more concrete. Washington wags note that even Nixon never destroyed the tapes, but Hillary has permanently erased her e-mails.Exactly what would a Hillary presidency look like, and could it plunge the nation into another round of debilitating Clinton scandals? That s a question Democrats should ask themselves before they hand the nomination over to her.  Many Democrats have reservations about Hillary s cozy relations with Wall Street, her 2002 vote for the Iraq War, and the Clinton couple s  flexibility  on issues.  They love winning. They re both masters of it, Hillary maybe even more than Bill. But that s not the same as having a belief system,  noted the liberal Rolling Stone magazine. But some Democrats also want Hillary to be challenged on her Nixonian penchant for slipperiness and questionable fundraising.A strong primary challenge has provided clues as to how she would run in a general election   something Democrats should know. After all, the first Clinton presidency was good for the Clintons, but not for the Democratic party, which lost both houses of Congress along with a majority of the nation s governorships   and during a time of economic prosperity and peace.Read more: National Review",politics,31-Mar-15

MUSLIM WOMAN ARRESTED FOR SPITTING ON HER FELLOW WHITE WALMART SHOPPERS BUT WHAT HAPPENS NEXT IS MORE UPSETTING,"This woman s having trouble entering the Walmart so people go to help her SHE SPITS ON THEM! Her reasoning for this disgusting behavior is that  Americans are pushing us around . She s arrested BUT what happens next is what s so disturbing.A Saudi Arabian national faces hate crimes charges after allegedly spitting on several people at a Florida Walmart.Nuha Mohammed Al-Doaifi was arrested in Palm Bay after police responded to a 911 call, Florida Today reported Tuesday.The 21-year-old, who was with her 2-year-old son at the time, allegedly admitted to authorities she spat on several people because  Americans are pushing us around. The incident began, police said, when a woman approached Al-Doaifi when she appeared to be having difficulty entering the Walmart. All I was trying to do was tell her she was coming in through the out door,  Terry Rakowski told Florida Today.  She was just ramming (her cart) into the door. The 39-year-old then claims the woman spat in her face. She just spit all over me,  she said.Al-Doaifi then allegedly did the same thing to several others inside the Walmart. Her actions were directed at random people based on their ethnicity, and that s according to her own statement,  said a spokeswoman for the Palm Bay Police Department.BUT THIS IS WHAT S EVEN MORE DISTURBING:Don t bother trying to hit the link to the original source  Florida Today . As soon as this story started to appear at other websites they yanked the story, scrubbed it completely. You can t even find the original report by searching for this woman s name, all you get is a 404  page not found. It s like it never happened and she doesn t exist.Apparently, hate crimes is a one way street, especially when committed by a Muslim against white folks.You have to wonder why she s even here if she hates white Americans so much. The next question is whether the Obama regime will deport her back to the big sandbox from whence she came.I m gonna say, probably not.VIA: BLUR BRAIN",politics,01-Apr-15
