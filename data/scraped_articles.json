He has also trimmed 13 minutes from the movie, which still runs a characteristically epic two hours and 37 minutes.\n\nReceiving a limited theatrical run in advance of a digital and Blu-ray release, the modestly revised film can't fix everything that ailed the original, beginning with the casting of Sofia Coppola, the director's daughter, in a pivotal role; and the absence of Robert Duvall, who opted not to return as consilgiere Tom Hagen due to a salary dispute . (George Hamilton filled the void, unremarkably, and seems to make a somewhat clearer contribution in this incarnation, if memory serves.)\n\n\"The Godfather\" and its first sequel remain in the discussion among the greatest movies of all time, and the chronologically arranged \"Godfather Saga\" serves as a showcase of how neatly the latter's flashbacks of a young Vito Corleone (played by Robert De Niro) expanded the story.\n\nThe third movie, on the other hand, came 16 years later, and despite the kick of Al Pacino reprising the role of Michael Corleone and Andy Garcia's ferocious performance as Vincent, his brother's out-of-wedlock son, pales by comparison. It's by no means a disaster, but with expectations understandably sky high, not the final chapter for which one might have hoped.\n\nRead More", "link": "http://edition.cnn.com/2020/12/03/entertainment/the-godfather-coda/index.html", "published": "2020-12-03T00:00:00"}, {"title": "Miley Cyrus only has love for Liam Hemsworth", "text": "(CNN) Miley Cyrus has no hard feelings for ex-husband Liam Hemsworth.\n\nThe singer visited Howard Stern's SiriusXM show on Wednesday, where she discussed her marriage to Hemsworth and why it ended not long after a Malibu fire destroyed the couple's home in 2018.\n\n\"Me being an intense person and not wanting to sit with it and not wanting to go, you know, 'What could be purposeful about this?'

The government is working to an existing target of cutting emissions by 57% compared with 1990 levels by 2030.\n\nLast month the government unveiled a 10-point plan for a \u201cgreen industrial revolution\u201d that included a ban on the sale of diesel and petrol cars from 2030.\n\nAuditors examined the government\u2019s legislation, proposed by Theresa May in 2019 and endorsed by Johnson, to cut greenhouse gases as much as possible and offset remaining pollution by planting trees or using technology to capture carbon over the next 30 years.\n\nThe target is significantly more challenging than the previous target to cut emissions by 80% by mid-century, which the UK is not on track to meet, the report says. The costs of failing to act would be far greater because of the need to adapt to substantial changes in climate, auditors said, such as building flood defences and dealing with the impacts on health of higher temperatures.\n\nMinisters need to spearhead a \u201cconcerted national effort\u201d to achieve net zero, says the report. This would probably involve widespread changes to people\u2019s lives such as driving electric cars or eating less meat. The government will need to \u201cengage actively and constructively with all those who will need to play a part \u2013 across the public sector, with industry and with citizens \u2013 to inject the necessary momentum\u201d, the report says.\n\nThe auditors said the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (Beis) and the Treasury were not collating the total costs and benefits of policies that would contribute to net zero, and they should gather information on how much the government was spending to achieve net zero.\n\nThe government has aimed to set an example for other countries to follow in the run-up to hosting the 26th United Nations\u2019 Climate Change Conference of the Parties (Cop26). The conference is due to take place in Glasgow in November 2021, having been postponed from November 2020 because of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nPlans by Beis to set out a clear net zero strategy before Cop26 were a \u201ccritical step\u201d for achieving the emissions cuts, to help identify people, policies and funding, auditors said.\n\nGareth Davies, the head of the NAO, said: \u201cWhile emissions have reduced steadily in recent years, achieving net zero is an enormously challenging long-term project, which will require well-thought-out cross-government coordination to drive unprecedented changes across society and the economy.\n\n\u201cGovernment needs to step up to the challenge, ensuring it has a clear strategy to achieve its goal and accurately monitoring progress.\u201d"}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/dec/04/friday-briefing-crunch-weekend-in-brexit-deal-talks", "published": "2020-12-04T06:28:48", "title": "Friday briefing: Crunch weekend in Brexit deal talks", "text": "Top story: \u2018We are in the space of days not weeks\u2019\n\nHello, Warren Murray with one more briefing to cap off the week.\n\nBritish and EU negotiators may be entering their last few days to reach a post-Brexit trade deal. Monday looms as the potential cut-off date, being when Downing Street intends to reinsert clauses into the internal market bill that would break the withdrawal agreement. EU sources have said their chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, could return to Brussels today to brief officials and diplomats on the latest developments. Negotiations were said to have taken a sudden step backwards on Thursday afternoon, with Downing Street blaming the French for introducing late demands about the regulation of subsidies \u2013 a claim dismissed by Brussels. The Guardian revealed on Tuesday that Johnson had lowered his Brexit demands by asking EU fishing fleets to hand over up to 60% of the value of stocks they take from British waters, down from 80%, but this was rejected by the EU.\n\nSenior EU diplomats on Thursday said Barnier was treading on some of the \u201cred lines\u201d set out for him in the negotiations, although they expected him not to go further. The Irish taoiseach, Miche\u00e1l Martin, said the EU should trust in Barnier to deliver. \u201cWe are now at a very critical and sensitive point of the negotiations \u2026 I want to see a deal done and I believe a deal is possible.\u201d Ireland\u2019s foreign minister, Simon Coveney, said: \u201cWe are in the space of days not weeks.

After Labour\u2019s crushing defeat in last December\u2019s general election, Starmer is minded to whip his MPs to vote in favour of a deal, partly to send a message to Brexit voters whose seats Labour lost to the Tories.\n\nMask America safe again \u2013 Joe Biden intends to call for all Americans to wear masks for 100 days after he becomes president.

The National Audit Office says they may be in use overseas or in the UK. The PAC speculated that some might be stuffed under mattresses or circulating in the shadow economy. The Bank has said more people are probably hoarding cash during the Covid-19 pandemic. Meg Hillier, chair of the PAC, said: \u201c\u00a350bn of sterling notes \u2013 or about three-quarters of this precious and dwindling supply \u2013 is stashed somewhere but the Bank of England doesn\u2019t know where, who by, or what for, and doesn\u2019t seem very curious.\u201d\n\nMerkel hard act to follow \u2013 In 15 years in power Angela Merkel has gained a reputation as Germany\u2019s \u201cTeflon chancellor\u201d because her opponents\u2019 criticism never seemed to stick.

But the prospect of a much harsher regulatory climate will be of concern to online casino bosses and bookmakers.\n\nMultiple sources said officials at the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS), which is leading the process, would take aim at almost every area of gambling law, in what one insider termed a \u201creformer\u2019s shopping list\u201d.\n\nOne key area in their sights is regulation of online casino and electronic slot machine games. Gamblers can bet unlimited amounts online, even though some internet-based games such as roulette are no different from those that were available on fixed-odds betting terminals, whose maximum stake was cut for \u00a3100 to \u00a32.\n\nAlongside maximum stakes, ministers will consider whether firms should be forced to limit players\u2019 monthly losses and carry out much stricter affordability checks to ensure people are gambling within their means.\n\nIt follows a string of high-profile incidents in which problem gamblers were left destitute after losing large sums of money. In one case, an online betting firm accepted a \u201cVIP\u201d gambler\u2019s redundancy payout as proof he could afford to keep betting. In another, high street bookmakers were accused of knowingly allowing a problem user to gamble away compensation for an injury that had left him severely disabled.\n\nUnder proposals to be weighed up by the DMCS, new gambling products could also be subjected to a rigorous testing regime that would determine whether they are released on to the market and how much can be wagered on them.\n\nThe UK gambling industry\u2019s lobby group, the Betting & Gaming Council, has repeatedly said tightening the regulations too far could fuel parallel market betting operations that have a scant regard for customer safety. But the DCMS will consider giving the regulator, the Gambling Commission, which has admitted it is underfunded, extra financial resources and new powers to tackle illicit operators.\n\nSources said the review would also consider marketing and advertising, including the possibility of new measures to curb sports sponsorship \u2013 including logos on football club shirts \u2013 in an apparent response to the \u201cgamblification\u201d of football.\n\nPromotional offers are also expected to form part of the review\u2019s scope, indicating that the government is not satisfied with a joint effort by the industry and the Gambling Commission to address concerns about VIP schemes, bonuses and so-called \u201cfree bets\u201d.\n\nVIP schemes, in which gamblers who lose large amounts of money are wined, dined and given financial incentives to keep betting, have been a common feature of high-profile stories about problem gamblers who resorted to crime or took their own lives.\n\nThe DCMS is not expected to take on the much-criticised lack of funding for treatment of gambling addiction, indicating that it will be left to the Department of Health and Social Care to address concerns about the availability of help for people with a gambling disorder.\n\nThe review is likely to be overseen by the sports minister, Nigel Huddleston, but Boris Johnson is understood to be keen on dialling back the Blair-era legislation that gave rise to the modern UK gambling industry.\n\nSenior officials in Downing Street are also believed to see gambling reform as a vote-winner, as well as the right thing to do. \u201cThe PM just sees it as people being exploited and it\u2019s not him,\u201d one MP with knowledge of No 10\u2019s thinking said earlier this year."}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/dec/04/anthony-fauci-apologises-for-implied-criticism-of-speedy-uk-vaccine-approval", "published": "2020-12-04T00:15:58", "title": "Anthony Fauci apologises for implied criticism of speedy UK vaccine approval", "text": "America\u2019s leading infectious diseases scientist, Anthony Fauci, has apologised for implying that he thought Britain\u2019s drug regulator had rushed through its coronavirus vaccine approval.\n\nHis comments came a day after Britain became the first country to approve the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine for general use, prompting some scepticism among European neighbours and suggestions of politicisation.\n\nFauci, who leads the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told the BBC: \u201cI have a great deal of confidence in what the UK does both scientifically and from a regulator standpoint.\n\n\u201cOur process is one that takes more time than it takes in the UK.

When furlough and other support measures come to an end in the spring, unemployment is expected to grow and many more families will turn to benefits.\n\n\u201cAfter so many redundancies on the high street this year, there is a chance of unemployment rising to levels last seen in the 1980s and 1990s. Alongside the planned benefit cuts this will push an extra 3 million people into poverty. The government must act now and put the 2020 benefit uplift on to a permanent footing.\u201d\n\nThe Fabian report said it had modelled the likely impact on poverty of the scenarios for unemployment contained in last week\u2019s analysis of the prospects for the economy from the Office for Budget Responsibility. The OBR\u2019s central forecast is for the jobless rate to peak at 7.5% next summer, but it also said the economy might perform better or worse. If things went better than expected, unemployment would peak at 5.1%; if they went less well it would rise to 11%.\n\nThe Fabian study said the OBR\u2019s central forecast assumed unemployment would peak after 1.5 years \u2013 much more quickly than in past recessions.

Castex said Europe\u2019s coastal communities would not be treated as a pawn in the wider trade and security talks.\n\nBut in response to calls from Olivier Lepr\u00eatre, the president of the Hauts-de-France regional committee for maritime fisheries, for maintaining current access to UK waters, the prime minister counselled that France had to accept a new reality.\n\n\u201cIt is a negotiation and a negotiation must lead to compromises,\u201d Castex said. \u201cAnd we must be with you in these compromises. A new era is about to begin. I would like there to be a specific support plan \u2026 the state will take its responsibilities.\u201d\n\nDuring a briefing on Wednesday, the French ambassador in Brussels had told Barnier that Paris would prefer to restart talks with the UK in 2021 rather than rush into a deal damaging to European interests.\n\nFrance was far from isolated among the 27 member states\u2019 representatives in advising Barnier that in several key areas he was close to over-stepping his negotiating mandate, with one diplomat on Thursday suggesting the EU negotiator was treading \u201con the red line\u201d in the most contentious areas.\n\nBut on Thursday the Irish taoiseach, Miche\u00e1l Martin, said the EU should trust in Barnier to deliver. \u201cWe are now at a very critical and sensitive point of the negotiations,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to see a deal done and I believe a deal is possible. It\u2019s clear to me that the landing zone is there for an agreement.

Closing out a negotiation as complex as this one is never going to be easy. It\u2019s going to be full of tension and standoffs, as both sides try to close out a deal that is acceptable.\u201d\n\nEU sources said there were just days left for a deal with Monday pencilled in as a cut-off date because of Downing Street\u2019s intention to reinsert Brexit clauses allowing it to disapply parts of the withdrawal agreement into the internal market bill, which returns to the Commons on Monday.\n\nOn Wednesday, Johnson\u2019s press secretary, Allegra Stratton, said the prime minister was hopeful of a deal, but equally confident if talks failed. \u201cHe is optimistic but he\u2019s also always said that he is confident and comfortable that we would be OK without a deal.\u201d\n\nWhile the fishing industry accounts for less than 0.1% of the British economy, the sector is emblematic of Brexit, with Johnson frequently declaring the importance of establishing sovereignty and control over who has access to British waters, including the narrow strait at the Channel, where the French land 80% of the cod catch.\n\nThe Guardian revealed on Tuesday that Johnson had lowered his Brexit demands by asking EU fishing fleets to hand over up to 60% of the value of stocks it takes from British waters, down from 80%, but this has been rejected by the EU.\n\nAt an event organised by the European Policy Centre thinktank, Stefaan De Rynck, a senior member of Barnier\u2019s team, said \u201csignificant divergences\u201d remained and that the outcome of talks was uncertain.

At about 10km above ground, a parachute will open and, if all goes to plan, the capsule will send out signals indicating its location on the ground.\n\nJaxa experts, who arrived at Woomera last month, have set up satellite dishes at several places to pick up the signals, while the Australian space agency and the Department of Defence will be on standby to help in the search and retrieval mission.\n\nWithout local assistance, the search for the capsule, which is just 40cm in diameter, \u201cwould be extremely difficult\u201d, Yoshikawa said.\n\nHayabausa2\u2019s work will not yet be done at that point, however.

The DOJ added:\n\nThe positions that were the subject of Facebook\u2019s alleged discrimination against U.S. workers offered an average salary of approximately $156,000. According to the lawsuit, and based on the department\u2019s nearly two-year investigation, Facebook intentionally created a hiring system in which it denied qualified U.S. workers a fair opportunity to learn about and apply for jobs that Facebook instead sought to channel to temporary visa holders Facebook wanted to sponsor for green cards. \u2026 In its investigation, the department determined that Facebook\u2019s ineffective recruitment methods dissuaded U.S. workers from applying to its PERM positions. The department concluded that, during the relevant period, Facebook received zero or one U.S. worker applicants for 99.7 percent of its PERM positions, while comparable positions at Facebook that were advertised on its careers website during a similar time period typically attracted 100 or more applicants each. These U.S. workers were denied an opportunity to be considered for the jobs Facebook sought to channel to temporary visa holders, according to the lawsuit.\n\nThe discriminatory behavior alleged by the DOJ is reportedly widespread among Silicon Valley and Fortune 500 companies, partly because visa fraud and anti-American discrimination are enabled by loopholed federal laws.\n\nThe legal process used by corporations to get green cards and work permits for their foreign workers is \u201chighly susceptible to fraud,\u201d a November report by the Department of Labor\u2019s Inspector General (IG) said.\n\n\u201cThe H-1B visa [worker program] has no requirement for employers to prove they first tried hiring American workers,\u201d said a December 3 tweet from U.S. Tech Workers, a group that campaigns against the visa worker program. \u201cBut the Employment-Based Green Card process does \u2026 [so] companies like Facebook need to find ways to turn down Americans so their [H-1B] foreign worker can get a Green Card.\u201d\n\nFor example, in June, Breitbart News reported:\n\nFacebook has a policy of favoring H-1B workers over Americans, and encouraging hiring managers to favor Chinese and Korean visa workers over other visa workers, according to a leaked document released by Project Veritas. \u201cWhen hiring for HR positions, it\u2019s important to prioritize H-1B visa workers, and this will stimulate the process of diversification of the workplace,\u201d says the March 2020 document, titled \u201cDiversity Initiative.\u201d Federal data shows that the company includes a large population of H-1Bs, including many Indian H-1B workers. The memo says that \u201cpriority may be given to H-1B applicants from China and Korea to foster larger communities of diverse workers at Facebook.\u201d The document also says that foreign applicants can be favored over American graduates. \u201cAlthough not mandatory, we recognize that the priority of H-1B applicants in favor of American applicants is for the greater good of company culture,\u201d the document reads.\n\nCorporate bias in favor of foreign workers sidelines millions of American graduates and denies them good jobs in Fortune 500 companies.\n\nThe hiring of foreign contract workers has also displaced millions of American professionals and has forced many into retirement or alternative careers, including real estate and journalism. In particular, the CEO-imported laborforce of Indian workers, managers, and subcontractors has also imported India\u2019s workplace culture, pay scales, and labor practices into the U.S. white-collar labor market.\n\nFrom 2016 to 2019, the median or midpoint income of college graduates fell by two percent, according to a September report by the federal reserve., even as wages for blue-collar jumped sharply.\n\nThe salary drop happened as companies have created a huge and captive third-class workforce of roughly 600,000 foreigners who must keep working for the companies that sponsored them for green cards.", "link": "http://www.breitbart.com/economy/2020/12/03/trumps-doj-sues-zuckerbergs-facebook-anti-american-discrimination/", "published": "2020-12-03T00:00:00"}, {"title": "Kamala Harris, Her Big Tech Donors Score Win with Green Card Giveaway", "text": "Sen.

The giveaway fast-tracks them.\n\nExisting rules ensure that companies can only give out 70,000 green cards to foreign workers every year with a maximum 11,000 of those green cards going to Indian nationals. The giveaway increases that annual rate of green card allotment up to 140,000 a year with perhaps 100,000 going to Indian nationals annually.\n\nPolitically, the giveaway is a major legislative victory for Harris who c0-sponsored the legislation last year with Lee. The win comes less than two months before Harris could be sworn in as vice president to Democrat Joe Biden, freeing them up from legislative hurdles with the giveaway.\n\nThe largest beneficiaries of the giveaway remain the tech corporations that served as political boosters for Harris as mega-donors in the 2019 Democrat presidential primary and the 2020 presidential election.\n\nTechNet, the group which advocates on behalf of Big Tech, served as one of the main lobbying pressures for the giveaway. TechNet\u2019s CEO Linda Moore donated the maximum donation of $2,800 to Harris\u2019 failed presidential bid. When Biden named Harris as his running mate, TechNet praised the decision noting their close ties to the California Democrat.\n\nOther Harris donors who lobbied for the giveaway, and are set to benefit, include:\n\nMicrosoft\n\nAmazon\n\nSalesforce\n\nFacebook\n\nGoogle\n\nIBM\n\nLast year, 140 House Republicans helped 224 House Democrats pass the giveaway after a huge lobbying effort by Big Tech corporations, the Chamber of Commerce, and the billionaire Koch brothers\u2019 network of organizations.\n\nThe legislative path forward for the giveaway, insiders told Breitbart News, is to have the House pass an identical version of the Senate-approved legislation which would send it straight to President Trump\u2019s desk for signage or a veto.

John Cornyn (R-TX) and Susan Collins (R-ME), both of whom just won reelection, say the U.S. Senate must start with an amnesty for illegal aliens enrolled in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program in an effort to reach \u201ccomprehensive immigration reform.\u201d\n\nDuring a summit hosted by the pro-amnesty, pro-mass immigration group American Business Immigration Coalition, Cornyn said he considers an amnesty for the roughly 800,000 illegal aliens enrolled in DACA \u2014 and potentially the millions more who are eligible for the program \u2014 a starting point in the new Congress.\n\n\u201cI personally think the most important starting point is DACA \u2026 in my view, DACA is a good place to start,\u201d Cornyn said.\n\nCornyn\u2019s opinion is vital as he currently heads the Senate Subcommittee on Border Security and Immigration and is a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee. During his remarks, Cornyn suggested working with Joe Biden\u2019s White House on a DACA amnesty.\n\n\u201cThe only way to achieve [comprehensive immigration reform] is Congress working on a bipartisan basis with the White House,\u201d Cornyn said. \u201cSo I believe we need to take action and give these young men and women the certainty they deserve.\u201d\n\nLikewise, Collins \u2014 who most recently staved off a challenge from Democrat Sara Gideon \u2014 said the first issue on immigration that the new Congress should advance is an amnesty for DACA illegal aliens.\n\n\u201cThere are three areas that we could start with. The first is the DACA population, the DREAMers,\u201d Collins said before touting her support for H-2B visas, H-2A visas, and more foreign worker migration to take U.S. jobs in rural areas.\n\nCurrently, House Democrats are drafting an amnesty plan that will provide at least one subgroup of illegal aliens the ability to permanently remain in the U.S. and eventually apply for American citizenship. Democrat presidential candidate Joe Biden has vowed to send an amnesty plan to the Senate in his first 100 days in office.\n\nA DACA amnesty would put more citizen children of illegal aliens \u2014 commonly referred to as \u201canchor babies\u201d \u2014 on federal welfare, as Breitbart News reported, while American taxpayers would be left potentially with a $26 billion bill.\n\nAdditionally, about one-in-five DACA illegal aliens, after an amnesty, would end up on food stamps, while at least one-in-seven would go on Medicaid.\n\nAt the southern border, a DACA amnesty has the potential to trigger a border surge that could triple the number of illegal aliens pouring through the border. Since DACA\u2019s inception, more than 2,100 recipients of the program have been kicked off because they were found to be criminals or gang members.\n\nJohn Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.

Period,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd what I will do is the same thing we did in our administration. There will be an absolute wall between personal and private [business interests] and the government. There wasn\u2019t any hint of scandal at all when we were there. And I\u2019m going to propose the same kind of strict, strict rules. That\u2019s why I never talked with my son or my brother or anyone else \u2014 even distant family \u2014 about their business interests. Period.\u201d\n\nHunter Biden contradicted his father in September 2019, noting that they had discussed Hunter\u2019s business dealings in Ukraine at least once while his father was in office. Joe Biden infamously withheld $1 billion in U.S. loan guarantees from Ukraine \u2014 by then under military assault from Russia \u2014 unless the Ukrainian government fired a prosecutor who had jurisdiction over inquiries into Burisma, the firm that had appointed Hunter Biden to a lucrative board position in 2014.\n\nEmails released by the New York Post in October from a laptop apparently belonging to Hunter showed that Joe Biden had met with one of Hunter\u2019s associates at Burisma. The emails also revealed Hunter Biden later tried to create a joint venture in 2017 with a Chinese company, in which Joe Biden was allegedly to have held a 10% stake.\n\nTapper did not ask Biden about these stories \u2014 which CNN has tried to suppress \u2014 but about future conflicts:\n\nTAPPER: When your son, Hunter came under scrutiny during the campaign, you vowed, \u201cNo one in my family or associated with me will be involved in any foreign operation whatsoever, period, end of story.\u201d Will your brothers? Will your son take leave from any business interests? Not just foreign, but any business interests that might create any even appearance of impropriety. BIDEN: My son, my family will not be involved in any business, any enterprise that is in conflict with or appears to be in conflict with where there\u2019s appropriate distance from the president and government.\n\nBreitbart News reported in July that Hunter Biden still owned a ten percent stake in Bohai Harvest RST (BHR), the firm he co-founded with a billion-dollar commitment from a Chinese government-controlled firm after a trip with his father to China in 2013 aboard Air Force Two.\n\nJoel B.

Let us know. Email us here.\n\nKeep up to date with our latest:\n\nWhen a huge silver monolith was spotted in a very remote section of the desert in southeastern Utah, it immediately created a media sensation.\n\nBut then it disappeared. A similar monolith had also been discovered in Romania, but now it is gone too. Then on Wednesday, everyone was buzzing about a third monolith that had been spotted in California.\n\nThey are being called \u201calien monoliths\u201d, but nobody knows who created them or if the three monoliths are even from the same source.\n\nBut after being bombarded by the science fiction movies that Hollywood has been creating for decades, the world is definitely hungry for news that we are being contacted by someone from beyond.\n\nThe monolith saga started last month when a biologist spotted a large shiny objectfrom the helicopter that he was flying in\u2026\n\nAlex Jones breaks down the Globalists\u2019 plan to push the population into submitting to their own destruction.\n\nOfficers from the Utah Department of Public Safety\u2019s Aero Bureau were flying by helicopter last Wednesday, helping the Division of Wildlife Resources count bighorn sheep in southeastern Utah, when they spotted something that seemed right out of \u201c2001: A Space Odyssey.\u201d \u201cOne of the biologists \u2026 spotted it, and we just happened to fly directly over the top of it,\u201d pilot Bret Hutchings told CNN affiliate KSL. \u201cHe was like, \u2018Whoa, whoa, whoa, turn around, turn around!\u2019 And I was like, \u2018What.\u2019 And he\u2019s like, \u2018There\u2019s this thing back there \u2014 we\u2019ve got to go look at it!\u2019\u201d\n\nThe Utah monolith appears to have been riveted together, and that would seem to indicate that human technology was used to construct it. We are being told that it was definitely very sturdy, and helicopter pilot Bret Hutchings estimated that it was \u201cbetween 10 and 12 feet high\u201d\u2026\n\nAnd there it was \u2014 in the middle of the red rock was a shiny, silver metal monolith sticking out of the ground. Hutchings guessed it was \u201cbetween 10 and 12 feet high.\u201d It didn\u2019t look like it was randomly dropped to the ground, he told KSL, but rather it looked like it had been planted.\n\nSubsequently, Internet sleuths discovered exactly where the Utah monolith was located and they used Google Earth to determine that it had appeared some time between August 2015 and October 2016\u2026\n\nAfter that, a Reddit user was able to find the monolith on Google Earth. The coordinates of the strange monolith are 38.343080\u00b0, -109.666190\u00b0 and plugging that into Google Earth shows you it\u2019s just south of Dead Horse Point State Park, between the park and Needles Point, a tourist outlook. Others used Google Earth\u2019s historical imaging data to narrow the appearance of the monolith in the area sometime between August of 2015 and October of 2016. As one of the internet sleuths pointed out, the three-sided monolith is miles from the closest paved road.\n\nSo it isn\u2019t as if this monolith came out of nowhere. Apparently it had been there for as long as five years.\n\nThe world was stunned when the Utah monolith suddenly disappeared, and at first nobody knew what happened to it.\n\nBut now two men have come forward and have admitted that they removed it\u2026\n\nAs mysteriously as it showed up, the strange monolith disappeared, and Sylvan Christensen and Andy Lewis now say they\u2019re among those responsible, according to reports. \u201cWe removed the Utah monolith because there are clear precedents for how we share and standardize the use of our public lands, natural wildlife, native plants, fresh water sources, and human impacts upon them,\u201d Lewis and Christensen said in a statement sent to Grit Daily.\n\nThey even posted a video on YouTube that shows them removing the monolith.\n\nChristensen and Lewis are just private citizens, and so it was rather presumptuous for them to grab what could have been a potentially important object.\n\nI think that it is quite likely that they will be getting a visit from law enforcement authorities.\n\nShortly after the Utah monolith was discovered, another monolith popped up in Romania\u2026\n\nThe mysterious metal structure in Romania was found a few metres from the well-known archaeological landmark the Petrodava Dacian Fortress. It is a dark metallic colour and appears to be covered in concentric scribble-like rings. The shiny triangular structure has a height of about four metres and one side faces Mount Ceahlau, known locally as the Holy Mountain.\n\nThis monolith appeared to be not constructed as well as the Utah monolith, and unlike the Utah monolith it suddenly appeared just recently.\n\nCould it have been created by a copycat?\n\nAt this point we don\u2019t know, and it is being reported that it is now gone\u2026\n\nBut Reuters reported Tuesday that the shiny metal Romanian monolith has disappeared, quoting journalist Robert Iosub of the local newspaper Ziar Piatra Neamt. \u201cThe 2.8 metre (9ft) tall structure disappeared overnight as quietly as it was erected last week,\u201d Iosub said.\n\nThat could have been the end of the story, but now another monolith has been found in California\u2026\n\nNow, yet another monolith has been discovered, this time in California. \u201cThere is currently a monolith at the top of Pine Mountain in Atascadero!\u201d tweeted Connor Allen on Wednesday afternoon, with a trio of pictures capturing the strange new monolith at the top of Pine Mountain in Atascadero, California.\n\nThis new monolith appears to be fairly flimsy, and according to a local news report it was first spotted on Wednesday morning\u2026\n\nAccording to local newspaper The Atascadero News, the monument appeared on the mountain on Wednesday morning. Hikers naturally flocked to take in the shiny metal object.\n\nA few years ago, the \u201ccreepy clown\u201d phenomenon took America by storm as hordes of copycats were inspired by a few initial news stories.\n\nIt looks like the same sort of thing may be happening again.\n\nWe live at a time when people are always looking for the next big social media stunt, and these monoliths have definitely gotten a lot of attention.\n\nMeanwhile, our world is literally coming apart at the seams all around us, and things are only going to get worse in the years ahead.\n\nWhen reality is unpleasant, many would rather focus on just about anything else, and these monoliths are definitely an interesting distraction. But all three of them appear to have been created by humans using very common technology, and so they aren\u2019t signs that the \u201caliens\u201d are about to arrive after all.\n\nBut without a doubt, our world has become a very strange place and it is getting stranger with each passing day.", "link": "https://www.infowars.com/posts/what-is-the-mystery-behind-all-of-the-alien-monoliths-that-have-been-suddenly-appearing-and-disappearing/", "published": "2020-12-03T02:47:59"}, {"title": "Candace Owens is Suing the \u2018Fact Checkers\u2019", "text": "Have an important tip?

It is being driven by government and central bank policies meant to shield us from the pain of the pandemic.\n\nThe problem is this government \u201chelp\u201d really isn\u2019t helping. In fact, it\u2019s made a bad situation much worse.\n\nThe Dow Jones was up 11.8% last month. It was the best November for the Dow since 1928. It was also the single best month since 1987. The S&P500 and the NASDAQ had their best months since the big rebound in April off the COVID-19 March lows.\n\nPeter said, \u201cThis is all bubble.\u201d\n\nWhile stocks were booming, we saw a mini-bust in gold. The yellow metal dropped about 5% on the month \u2013 this despite a weakening dollar. The dollar index slipped about 1% in November.\n\nAll of this market movement was triggered by a \u201crisk-on\u201d mentality sparked by optimism about a COVID vaccine. Investors fled safe havens and bought into riskier assets.\n\nSo, COVID will soon be a problem of the past, and so since the markets are forward-looking, the markets are now discounting all the great things that are going to flow from a COVID vaccine and we\u2019re pricing them in right now, so we\u2019re getting this huge rally. The problem is the market was already high before we got the news of these vaccines. It\u2019s not like the market was still near the March lows and everybody had discounted all the problems of COVID and now we can start pricing that out of the market because we have a vaccine. The market had already fully recovered before anybody had even talked about a vaccine. So now we have a rally when the market was already near the highs before the rally. So the vaccines simply caused a very expensive market to get even more expensive.\u201d\n\nThe markets are ignoring a fundamental question: is the US economy suddenly in great shape because of these vaccines?\n\nOf course not. We have been chronicling the deep damage done to the economy by the government response to coronavirus. As just one example, 17 million households are behind on rent or mortgage payments, and nearly 6 million Americans say they are at risk of eviction in the next few months.\n\nSo, why do we have markets that are higher today than they were before the pandemic?\n\nThe markets are not lower because of COVID. In fact, they\u2019re higher. And the reason the markets are higher, and the reason they\u2019ve rallied since the vaccine, has got nothing to do with COVID. It\u2019s all because of the Fed. It\u2019s all because of other central banks, not just the Fed, but it\u2019s the way central banks have responded to COVID.\u201d\n\nTheir prescription to cure COVID is to print trillions of dollars out of thin air.\n\nInflation is the cure for whatever ails us. And that\u2019s what we have. That\u2019s the prescription \u2013 and massive money printing, massive government spending \u2013 that\u2019s why the market was so strong. And that\u2019s why it continues to go up because the market realizes that it doesn\u2019t matter if COVID goes away. The monetary and fiscal policies that resulted from COVID are here to stay. In fact, they\u2019re going to be expanded, especially here in the United States because we took on so much additional debt to fight COVID \u2013 now the problem is the debt, not the disease. The disease that we really have is excess debt and excess money printing. And the Fed\u2019s cure for that is to print even more money so we can go even deeper into debt.\u201d\n\nAs Peter pointed out, the problem is the government thinks it had to shield everybody from the negative effects of a COVID downturn. But that\u2019s not the government\u2019s job.\n\nTo the extent that the economy is going to have a recession and that recession causes people to have pain, the government needs to allow that pain to be felt. Because that pain is going to result in people changing their behavior, modifying the decisions that they make to reflect economic reality.\u201d\n\nThe economy needs to adjust to the reality of COVID. If people are unemployed, the need to cut spending. If government revenue is down, the government needs to slash spending. But the Fed and the government didn\u2019t want that to happen. So they printed trillions of dollars so people could keep spending even though they weren\u2019t producing anything.\n\nThe problem is government doesn\u2019t seem to understand the difference between money that is actually earned by being productive and money you get just because the Federal Reserve or some other central bank conjures out of thin air. When you\u2019re productive, you\u2019re helping to grow the economy. When the Fed prints money, all they\u2019re doing is distorting the economy and increasing the cost of living.\u201d\n\nThe reason we\u2019re in so much trouble now is because the government has intervened so much in the economy and dumped in so much artificial stimulus.\n\nWhat the Federal Reserve and other central banks and government are doing \u2013 they are numbing up all the consumers and businesses so they don\u2019t feel the pain that they should be feeling, and they keep on spending and making decisions as if nothing bad had happened. And so at this point, the greater damage to the economy is not the damage from the virus itself, but the damage from the monetary and fiscal policy that was put in place to supposedly numb us from the pain of the virus. So, that doesn\u2019t go away. The cure for COVID doesn\u2019t do anything to cure that problem. In fact, that problem is now self-perpetuating and is going to get bigger and bigger and bigger. So, that\u2019s why nobody should have been selling gold based on these COVID cures. The outlook for gold has never been more bullish than it is right now.\u201d\n\nDr. Steve Pieczenik joins The Alex Jones Show to double down on his claim that a Deep State sting operation will expose the fraud in the Presidential Election of 2020.", "link": "https://www.infowars.com/posts/peter-schiff-government-help-is-not-helping/", "published": "2020-12-02T12:17:17"}, {"title": "Biden\u2019s \u201cPlanned-Opolis\u201d Future Will Enslave America", "text": "Have an important tip?

Bill Gates\u2019 Microsoft played a key role in developing the technology.\n\nSouth Korea was chosen for the test because, in the words of the city\u2019s developers, \u201cThere is an historical expectation of less privacy.\u201d The New York Times reported:\n\n\u201cMuch of this technology was developed in U.S. research labs, but there are fewer social and regulatory obstacles to implementing them in Korea,\u201d said Mr. Townsend [a research director at the Institute for the Future in Palo Alto, California], who consulted on Seoul\u2019s own U-city plan, known as Digital Media City. \u201cThere is an historical expectation of less privacy. Korea is willing to put off the hard questions to take the early lead and set standards.\u201d\n\nAn academic paper released in April of this year outlines how smart cities and artificial intelligence will be used for \u201cenforcement of guidelines, rules and government orders to contain such future outbreaks\u201c. The paper concludes that, \u201cThe proposed architecture and AI assisted applications\u2026 can be used to effectively and timely enforce social distancing community measures, and optimize the use of resources in critical situations.\u201d\n\nChina is building \u201cCOVID-proof\u201d cities \u201cwith future lockdowns in mind\u201c.\n\nIndia utilized its Varanasi smart city to enforce the COVID lockdown:\n\n\u201cTo keep a tight vigil on the movement of people during the lockdown and tab on home-quarantined people infected with covid-19, Varanasi, the PM\u2019s own constituency, is using CCTVs and geographic information system (GIS) technology accessed through its integrated command and control centre (ICCC) set up under the smart city mission.\u201d\n\nProud Boys leader Enrique Tarrio joins The Alex Jones Show to expose the leftist idealism taking hold in America, and how closely it resembles the militant authoritarian communism his family had to flee from in Cuba.", "link": "https://www.infowars.com/posts/bidens-planned-opolis-future-will-enslave-america/", "published": "2020-12-01T12:52:00"}, {"title": "Election Coup HEATS UP in Georgia at RIVETING Fraud Hearing Today: Thursday Night Live with DeAnna!", "text": "Have an important tip?

States will determine your place in line", "text": "These days, across America, the phone rings frequently with the same question at health departments, pharmacies, doctors' offices and advocacy groups: a line is forming for a Covid-19 vaccine, and people want to know where they stand.\n\nThe answers are often vague, whether posed to local officials or labor unions, associations for heart disease or diabetes, CVS corporate headquarters or leading professors of public health: \"Stand by.\" \"We have not heard from the federal government.\" \"We just don't know yet.\"\n\n\"We're so focused on understanding how the logistics of this vaccine will play out \u2026 that we're not drilling down to that common citizen asking, 'OK, when do I get my vaccine?'\" said Lori Tremmel Freeman, who heads the National Association of County and City Health Officials. \"We have to come up with a way to effectively communicate that broadly \u2026 so people understand it's their turn.\"\n\nThe first coronavirus vaccines could reach the American public as early as next week, and all adults should be able to get vaccinated in 2021, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nThe CDC anticipates there will be enough doses for 20 million people by the end of December. Because the initial supply will be scarce compared to demand, the government plans to distribute the vaccine in phases. A CDC advisory panel voted on Tuesday to recommend giving first priority to health care personnel and residents of long-term health care facilities. They will likely be followed by the elderly, people with high-risk comorbidities and essential workers.\n\nBut the new federal recommendation only covers Phase 1a, and the question of who counts in each of those first phase categories has yet to be determined. The rest of the population still does not know where they will fall within the amorphous later phases \u2014 or even how they will find out. Though professional groups have suggested frameworks for the CDC, there is still no complete federal plan.\n\nWhen it does come, state and local officials will be charged with implementing it. While the Trump administration invested billions to help develop vaccines, it largely left distribution logistics \u2014 including the specifics of who stands where in line \u2014 to state and local officials. They'll have to develop their own subcategories of eligible populations, then quickly communicate all of the details statewide. A limited review of state plans submitted last month showed that while some are specific, many are still preliminary, and many include no details about reaching the marginalized populations where the disease has spread the quickest.\n\nThe logistics of this decentralized model of distribution are complicated, even if everything were to occur exactly as theorized by experts at Johns Hopkins or the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine. To communicate whose turn it is, states expect to use a broad mix of social media, community outreach and public messaging campaigns. But challenges abound, from depleted health department budgets to confusing national guidance.\n\n\"There's a difference between what we write \u2026 and how things actually get implemented,\" said Jewel Mullen, associate dean for health equity at Dell Medical School at the University of Texas at Austin, who served on the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine's committee for the vaccine allocation framework. \"We can explain the technical pieces on paper. But then we rely on our decision makers at the state and local level to make it happen.\"\n\nSome experts worry that the communications infrastructure demonstrated so far is insufficient to keep Americans in an orderly, fast-moving line for a vaccine. Groups representing the people who may be tapped for early vaccine access \u2014 essential workers and people at high-risk \u2014 say they are hearing widespread confusion over vaccine access. Some stakeholders tell NBC News they could help with communication to these high-priority groups, but officials have not yet engaged them on the topic.\n\n\"Messaging about Covid-19, from the federal level \u2026 and the state level, has not always been delivered with clarity and consistency,\" said Dr. Eduardo Sanchez, chief medical officer for prevention at the American Heart Association and former Texas commissioner of health. \"But that confusion can be overcome by consistent messaging, clarity of messaging, and a clear understanding of who are those trustworthy messengers.\"\n\nA mismatch between supply and demand\n\nWhile hundreds of millions of routine vaccinations occur each year, until the arrival of the Covid-19 pandemic, officials have never had to navigate such a mismatch between vaccine supply and demand.\n\nTo help them, the CDC provided its national recommendations Tuesday on how to prioritize the first doses for 20 million people. The agency's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices voted to give the first vaccine access to health care workers and residents of long-term care facilities.\n\nThe committee has also identified three other demographics to \"possibly recommend\" for early vaccination: people 65 years and older, essential workers, and people with comorbidities that place them at high risk.\n\nUntil the committee votes on a full recommendation for later phases, the interim guidance raises questions for the average citizen. The definition of \"essential worker\" differs state-by-state, for example, and the list of comorbidities associated with severe Covid-19 has been fluid, as scientists continue to learn more about the disease. And even when these categories are ultimately defined, many Americans may find they don't fall neatly into a single demographic box.\n\n\"How do we tell people, 'Get in line, but don't skip the line?'\" Mullen said. \"Because suddenly, people may start to rationalize why maybe they actually fall into that box that's phase one or two, when they really belong in phase three.\"\n\nA resident of senior housing is tested for Covid-19 in Paterson, N.J., on May 8, 2020. In December, a CDC advisory panel recommended residents of senior housing and other long-term care facilities be among those who get first priority for coronavirus vaccines. Seth Wenig / AP file\n\nThe CDC's Phase 1a may prove deceptively simple in this regard, as nursing home residents and health care workers will likely be relatively easy to isolate and target. As the list of eligible recipients expands and diversifies, the challenge of how to manage the differentiated messages will grow.\n\nMany hoped the federal government would invest more in this communication effort, particularly in the wake of widespread criticism surrounding lack of federal coordination around testing. Among the suggestions are more funding for health departments and centralized national messaging. That could mean the creation of a national database where people can look up their priority level based on their demographics, as Bill Gates suggested on CNN, or something more simple, like the document published by the U.K. on Wednesday, which outlined nine initial tiers for sub-prioritization based on age, living situation, occupation and medical vulnerabilities.\n\nThe CDC did not respond to repeated requests for comment from NBC News.\n\n\"There could be and should have been more communications to the public about this from the federal government,\" said Eric Toner, a senior scholar with the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, who was the lead author for Johns Hopkins' Covid-19 vaccine allocation framework. \"I hope that they really start addressing these issues with the public, so the public has time to process and the information has time to filter down through the various communities, some of which are hard to reach.\"\n\nThe local approach\n\nLocal officials are likely better situated for the communications challenge, according to Tremmel Freeman, of the health officials association, simply because they have a better idea of where key populations are and how they get their information.\n\n\"You're not going to vaccinate from the state capital, just like you're not going to do testing from the White House,\" she said. \"You need that deep community engagement to strategize and inform what needs to be done, community by community.\"\n\nThat means engagement of local leaders, from pastors to principals, to reach hesitant individuals, experts say. Such strategies are particularly key to reaching historically marginalized and disenfranchised communities, Toner said, which is a public health priority \"not only for ethical and moral reasons, but because that's where a lot of the transmission of disease is happening.\"\n\n\"It's absolutely true that we can't reach them solely through public messaging,\" said Toner. \"States need to be working now to create the relationships in those communities with trusted leaders to encourage people to seriously think about getting vaccinated.\"\n\nIt remains unclear exactly how prepared state officials are for that challenge. When asked specifically about communications plans by NBC News, most states gave only broad details, while others merely linked to preliminary state distribution plans submitted to the CDC in October.\n\nA review of these public state plans reveal varying levels of detail. Some barely address phased allocation, while others outline phase-by-phase strategies using a range of communications avenues. Nebraska suggests outreach to churches, robo calls, and gas station video messages, while Florida floated YouTube ads, bus ads and radio spots. Others left difficult questions unresolved. Mississippi left blank boxes where it was supposed to outline notification strategies for essential workers and people with comorbidities.\n\nOnly about half of the state plans specifically mention vulnerable or minority populations, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation brief, while just over a third mention addressing misinformation. Less than half contain an estimate for the number of people considered high priority to get the vaccine.\n\n\"Some states had done their preparation and homework already, whereas other states are trying to catch up,\" said Josh Michaud, associate director for global health policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation. He noted that updates to the preliminary plans are due Friday. \"Given that we are imminently at the point of vaccine distribution, it is of the utmost importance to have this communications piece already worked out.\"\n\n'We sit there with no information'\n\nMeanwhile, for some Americans who believe they deserve prioritized vaccine access, anticipation is turning into frustration.\n\nNBC News contacted over a dozen groups representing Americans who may get early vaccine access, such as groups representing teachers, postal workers and funeral directors and organizations like the American Heart Association and the American Diabetes Association. The 11 who responded said they hoped their communities would be prioritized. But for the most part, they too did not know how phased allocation would play out for their subgroups, or how that eventual eligibility would be communicated.\n\n\"You watch the news and hear about a vaccine with millions of doses, going soon to essential workers,\" said Mark Lauritsen, international vice president and head of the food processing division of the United Food and Commercial Workers Union, which represents 1.3 million American workers. \"Then we sit there with no information. That just leads to frustration. The government could start pretty easily with just basic communication.\"\n\nThe union says it has the expertise and capacity to help the government effectively distribute a vaccine to tens of thousands of frontline workers nationwide. Trained medical personnel at processing plants, which have been hit hard by Covid-19, routinely distribute vaccinations, for example, and the union can help communicate with workers across dozens of languages. But so far, they say no one from the Trump administration has engaged them for such a partnership.\n\nInformation is lacking even for government employees, according to the International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers, a union representing highly skilled employees from judges to NASA rocket scientists. In a recent letter shared with NBC News, the union requested a copy of the federal government's plan to vaccinate its own workers \u2014 as well as assurances that frontline employees would be prioritized from outgoing Trump appointees.\n\n\"We really have not received any direction with regard to how the federal government plans on distributing the vaccine within their workforce,\" Paul Shearon, the union's president. \"That's what's caused us to question, how are you going to distribute this, and are you going to distribute it fairly?\"\n\nThis week could be a turning point for state and local communication strategies, given Tuesday's announcement on who will be eligible in phase 1a. But there is much more to be decided \u2014 and subsequently communicated \u2014 before the public at large knows when they can get a vaccine.\n\n\"Some of this communications planning could and should have been done right at the start of the pandemic, because we knew vaccines were in development,\" Tremmel Freeman said. \"We knew at some point they would hit the streets and we probably wouldn't have enough doses for 300 million people. That's just common sense.\"", "link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/which-people-get-covid-19-vaccine-first-states-will-determine-n1249763", "published": "2020-12-03T15:02:00+00:00"}, {"title": "3 vaccine executives say that after approval, distribution will be the main challenge", "text": "The top executives of Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson said in an NBC News interview that even after their companies developed potential Covid-19 vaccines at a breakneck pace, some of their biggest challenges still lie ahead, including quickly producing enough doses and ensuring fair distribution through the uneven U.S. health care system.\n\n\"We have never done anything like this,\" Johnson & Johnson CEO Alex Gorsky said, speaking of the logistics of reaching billions of people with potential vaccines.\n\nThe executives \u2014 Gorsky, Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla and Moderna President Stephen Hoge \u2014 spoke in an exclusive joint interview with NBC News' Lester Holt.

The FDA itself would weigh in next. FDA scientists are also reviewing data about another vaccine candidate made by Moderna, and a third candidate from Johnson & Johnson is in a late-stage trial. Some states have said they also want to conduct their own reviews.\n\nA member of an FDA advisory committee, Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, said in a separate interview: \"The standard we're going to hold this to is: Would I give this vaccine to myself or my own family? And if the answer to that question is 'I'm not sure,' then we're not going to move forward.\"\n\nThe United Kingdom formally approved the vaccine from Pfizer and its partner, BioNTech, on Wednesday, becoming the first country to have done so.\n\nHoge said Moderna already faced a significant setback in September because of the lack of trust that some communities of color have in the health care system. He said the company realized that the people who had enrolled in its late-stage vaccine trial weren't diverse enough to give Moderna the data it needed, so the company had to broaden its outreach.\n\n\"We said, 'We're going to take the time to do that now,'\" Hoge said. \"Because it's absolutely essential that this trial provide data that provides confidence to all of those communities, particularly those that are disproportionately impacted by Covid, and make sure they can have confidence that the vaccine works for them, as well.\n\n\"In the end, we were able to work with the investigators to build that trust and recruit the trial over the subsequent six to eight weeks. But it was a hard decision and a lot of work,\" he said.\n\nThe initial vaccine rollouts could be swift. If Pfizer receives approval, Bourla said, it has a logistics network in place, including specialized insulated boxes to keep doses cold \"to send vaccines within 24 hours basically in any place in the U.S.\"\n\nBourla said it's still unknown whether people who've been vaccinated could still be carriers of the virus, able to transmit it to others.\n\n\"I think this is something that needs to be examined. We are not certain about that right now,\" he said.\n\nBourla said researchers and regulators ought to find a way to quickly vaccinate participants in clinical trials who received placebo doses, an idea Pfizer said it was exploring last month. \"It is a moral and ethical dilemma and obligation, I think, that we have to these people,\" he said.\n\nThe executives said many factors contributed to making the vaccine candidates possible on timelines never before imagined. In particular, they cited the willingness of governments to buy doses of unproven candidates, which sped manufacturing and freed the companies of some financial worry.\n\n\"What's really the ingredient that's been taken out over the course of the past year is some of the financial and business caution that normally slows the development of drugs,\" Hoge said. He said the standards of quality for the vaccine trials weren't compromised.\n\nThe executives said they were kept in the dark as their companies collected data from the trials, in keeping with standard practice. Hoge said he didn't sleep for the 24 hours from when he was told he would finally see the results to when he saw them.\n\n\"They notified us of the vaccine efficacy and the number of cases that had happened on placebo \u2014 and the very small number that had happened on the vaccine. And I don't think I remember another thing for about 20 minutes,\" Hoge said.\n\n\"From the moment of hearing that result, there was this overwhelming sense of relief for the past \u2014 for that 24 hours, for the past year, for the past 10 years of work,\" he said.", "link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/3-vaccine-executives-say-after-approval-distribution-will-be-main-n1249928", "published": "2020-12-03T22:49:00+00:00"}, {"title": "When will Americans actually get the Covid vaccine?

Fauci said they discussed \"a variety of Covid-related topics.\" A senior transition official said Jeff Zients, who's expected to be the new administration's Covid-19 czar, led the discussion for the Biden team.\n\nBiden later told CNN in an interview that he asked Fauci to stay on as director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and also to serve as a chief medical adviser. Fauci had told NBC News on Thursday that he would stay in his current role and work closely with the new administration.\n\nBiden told CNN that he'd be \"happy\" to get publicly vaccinated if Fauci says it is safe. He also said that when he is inaugurated, he will ask Americans to wear masks for 100 days.\n\n\"It is important that we, in fact, the president and the vice president, we set the pattern by wearing masks, but beyond that, where the federal government has authority, I'm going to issue a standing order that in federal buildings you have to be masked,\" he said.\n\nHe added: \"Just 100 days to mask. Not forever. One hundred days. And I think we'll see a significant reduction ... if that occurs, with vaccinations and masking, to drive down the numbers considerably.\"\n\nIn an interview on MSNBC's \"Andrea Mitchell Reports\" before the virtual meeting, Fauci said he has talked informally with members of Biden's team, including Zients, to coordinate the response to the pandemic. He said he would be \"talking about just substantive, uncomplicated transition issues like vaccines and the state of the epidemic\" with the new administration.\n\nFauci said that he has spoken previously with Biden's White House chief of staff, Ron Klain, but that the meeting Thursday with the transition \"landing team,\" which is working on priorities for the early months of the Biden presidency, marked a more formal and substantive process.\n\nFauci said it will likely be the first of a series of transition meetings. He also said he fully expects to remain as director of the infectious diseases institute.\n\n\"What contribution I will make in the new administration depends on the new administration,\" Fauci said. \"But I cannot imagine I'm not going to be involved in the Covid-19 response. I mean, that would, I think, be unheard of if that's the case. But we'll see.\"\n\nThe White House task force response coordinator, Dr. Deborah Birx, also started her formal contact with the Biden transition team this week.\n\nMeanwhile, Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris were receiving the presidential daily briefing and meeting with transition team advisers Thursday. No public events were on their schedules.\n\nBiden said in his CNN interview that he doesn't personally care whether President Donald Trump attends his inauguration but that the outgoing president should present a peaceful transfer of power to the world. \"It's totally his decision, and it's of no personal consequence to me, but it is to the country,\" Biden said. \"I really worry about the image we're presenting to the rest of the world.\"\n\nBiden announced that Brian Deese, a former adviser to President Barack Obama, will be director of the National Economic Council. Deese, a former deputy director of the council and the Office of Management and Budget, was part of the Obama administration team that worked on environmental issues and the bailout of the auto industry.\n\nBiden could announce his health team as soon as next week, a transition official said, including his picks to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the new administration's response to the pandemic. Obama administration Surgeon General Vivek Murthy is a leading contender for HHS secretary, while Rhode Island Gov. Gina Raimondo took herself out of the running Thursday.\n\nObama and former Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams will headline a get-out-the-vote virtual rally Friday for the state's Democratic Senate candidates, Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock. The event will include a discussion with volunteers ahead of the state's voter registration deadline Monday and the start of in-person early voting on Dec. 14.\n\nHarris announced more senior staff appointments Thursday, including her chief of staff, Hartina Flournoy, who has served as former President Bill Clinton's chief of staff. Rohini Kosoglu, who will be a domestic policy adviser, has been with Harris since her days in the Senate, serving as her chief of staff. Nancy McEldowney, a 30-year veteran of the foreign service, will be Harris' national security adviser.\n\nTrump has not ruled out firing Attorney General William Barr, according to an administration official and two people familiar with the matter, who said a sudden departure is not seen as imminent. Trump publicly lashed out at Barr during a White House event Thursday, telling reporters, \"He hasn't done anything.\"\n\nThe Wisconsin Supreme Court rejected an emergency lawsuit filed by the Trump campaign, which sought to invalidate mailed ballots that it claimed were improperly included during the canvass in Milwaukee and Dane counties.\n\nWhite House communications director Alyssa Farah announced that she is leaving the job.\n\nTrump had no public events on his schedule.

He had mental breakdowns, emergency surgeries and even a stomach-stapling operation. Yet still, to so many who idolized him, including yours truly, it\u2019s hard to accept that he\u2019s gone \u2014 the improbability of an immortal fading from the scene before the telling of his myth has finished.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSuch is the global power of both soccer and Maradona\u2019s legend that his death wasn\u2019t just an Argentine tragedy. Memorials and murals to the irrepressible attacker \u2014 arguably the greatest player in the sport\u2019s history \u2014 sprang up on almost every continent. In his adopted city of Naples, where figurines of Maradona often sit alongside those of Christ in seasonal Nativity displays, countless fans converged on the cavernous stadium that bore witness to perhaps his greatest triumph. In the Indian state of Kerala, thousands of miles away from the sites of Maradona\u2019s celebrated exploits, the local government declared two days of official mourning.\n\nFrom a sporting perspective, Maradona sits atop soccer\u2019s pantheon, with perhaps only the Brazilian Pel\u00e9 for company. In years to come, they\u2019ll likely be joined by the Portuguese Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi, another Argentine, both players whose lists of personal accolades surpass those of the older pair.\n\nBut the extent of Maradona\u2019s celebrity \u2014 and the fervor of his admirers \u2014 may never be seen again. When he cemented his fame by leading Argentina to victory in the 1986 World Cup, he did so at a time when World Cups mattered more. The surfeit of soccer on show now and the ubiquitousness of its stars on social media have demystified the game from the days when many fans would have to wait four years to get a real glimpse of its heroes. Moreover, neither Ronaldo nor Messi seems to possess the same powers of transcendence that coursed through Maradona\u2019s career and life.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIn this age of hyper-marketing and commercial packaging, these immense footballers seem like alien creatures cut from steel, polished with hair gel,\u201d wrote my twin Kanishk Tharoor in a 2014 essay for the Times of India. \u201cOne gets the sense that at the end of the day, Messi and Ronaldo return to their spaceship-like mansions to power off, to sleep a dreamless robotic sleep. Maradona, on the other hand, offered the illusion that no barrier separated the field of his renown from the world beyond. Both on and off the pitch, he was the scrappy child of the slums, snarling exuberance and desire.\u201d\n\nMaradona was a true populist. He grew up in a shantytown on the outskirts of Buenos Aires and would be defined by his determination to both escape and yet still represent his origins. He absorbed the pejoratives of his place \u2014 both the \u201cnegrito,\u201d the little \u201cBlack\u201d boy with Indigenous blood looked down upon by more well-to-do (and White) Argentines, and the \u201cpibe,\u201d the cunning rascal of the streets.\n\nIt was the impudent \u201cpibe\u201d who scored the infamous \u201chand of God\u201d goal against England in the 1986 World Cup, where he knocked in the ball with a clenched fist. He followed up that act of cheating with one of genius, a slaloming run through the English team that ended with the ball in the net and a weeping commentator for Argentina thanking God mid-broadcast \u201cfor football, for Maradona, for these tears.\u201d Four years after the humiliation of the Falklands War, Maradona \u201cgave us the best (and probably the only) payback we could get as a nation,\u201d wrote Argentine journalist Juan Manuel R\u00f3tulo. \u201cOne hero to mend the open wound of millions.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAnd it was the \u201cnegrito\u201d who captured the hearts of Naples. Maradona arrived in one of Europe\u2019s poorest cities and took its middling team, Napoli, to unprecedented glory. He internalized the widespread bigotry that northern Italians voiced against Neapolitans and channeled it into an almost moral mission on the pitch. In footage of those matches, you don\u2019t see Maradona just wearing his heart on his sleeve. In the ferocious churn of his elbows, the surge of his stocky frame, you can almost hear that heart beating.\n\n\u201cIt had been more than half a century since this city, condemned to suffer the furies of Vesuvius and eternal defeat on the soccer field, had last won a [major trophy], and thanks to Maradona the dark south finally managed to humiliate the white north that scorned it,\u201d wrote the late Uruguayan author Eduardo Galeano. \u201cIn the stadiums of Italy and all Europe, Napoli kept on winning, cup after cup, and each goal constituted a desecration of the established order and a revenge against history.\u201d\n\nMaradona perhaps took the mantle of champion of the global South too far. Much to his critics\u2019 ire, he embraced leftist Latin American strongmen such as Fidel Castro and Hugo Ch\u00e1vez. In his own life, he was no moral exemplar, leaving behind a trail of lavish waste, mafia ties, unpaid taxes, allegedly abused women and neglected children. At his death, it seemed there was no closure to his endless struggle with addiction.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cHe was a perfect embodiment of the human ability to be contradictory, to do and convey ugly and beautiful at once, good and evil in the same stroke,\u201d wrote Marcela Mora y Araujo, a Buenos Aires-based journalist who translated Maradona\u2019s autobiography into English. \u201cHis celebrity was not separate from his private self \u2014 he was achingly human in every way, yet a superstar at all times.\u201d\n\nAs Galeano put it, Maradona was \u201cthe most human of the gods.\u201d He also may be one of the last."}, {"link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/obituaries/irina-antonova-dead/2020/12/03/2309b444-34b9-11eb-8d38-6aea1adb3839_story.html?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=wp_world", "published": "2020-12-03T16:39:34", "title": "Irina Antonova, grande dame of Russian cultural life, dies at 98", "text": "The cause was acute cardiovascular failure complicated by the novel coronavirus, according to an announcement by her longtime professional home, formally the Pushkin State Museum of Fine Arts.\n\nAlong with the State Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg, the Pushkin Museum, inaugurated in 1912 as the Alexander III Museum of Fine Arts, is one of the preeminent artistic institutions in Russia.\n\nAD\n\nMs. Antonova joined the Pushkin upon her university graduation in 1945, a month before the end of World War II. A specialist in the Italian Renaissance, she became director in 1961 and remained in that role until 2013, when she assumed the title of president. In the international press, she was often described as a grande dame of Russian cultural life.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cCommunism fell, the Soviet Union collapsed, but some things in Moscow never change,\u201d a New York Times reporter dryly observed in 2002. \u201cAt the State Pushkin Museum of Fine Arts, Irina A. Antonova is still the director.\u201d\n\nShe described the early years of her employment as \u201ca terribly sad time,\u201d when the entire museum was commandeered to display gifts to Soviet leader Joseph Stalin. Under Stalin, and for years after his death in 1953, officially sanctioned artwork emphasized a Socialist Realist glorification of the heroic proletariat. Many of the museum\u2019s most prized holdings were consigned to storage.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cFor so many years, we weren\u2019t allowed to exhibit what we had in our collections,\u201d Ms. Antonova told the German publication Der Spiegel in 2012. \u201cRenoir, Matisse, Picasso and C\u00e9zanne were considered formalistic and bourgeois artists.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThrough unyielding resolve, Ms. Antonova helped resurrect the works of those artists and others, such as Marc Chagall and Wassily Kandinsky, who were regarded as traitors for having left the Soviet Union for the West.\n\nIn 1974, according to the Times, Ms. Antonova threatened to resign if she was not permitted to display the exuberantly colorful works of French painter Henri Matisse, a chief exponent of the artistic movement known as Fauvism.\n\nAD\n\nThe same year, she arranged for Leonardo da Vinci\u2019s Mona Lisa to be transported to Moscow from the Louvre in Paris and displayed at the Pushkin behind bulletproof glass \u2014 one of several celebrated exchanges she orchestrated during the Cold War.\n\nIn collaboration with the Centre Pompidou, also in Paris, she mounted a groundbreaking exhibition, \u201cMoscow-Paris,\u201d in 1981, with works by Chagall and Kandinsky, among other Russian and French artists. Other Soviet museum administrators had balked at such an idea.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe director of the State Tretyakov Gallery said, \u2018Over my dead body,\u2019 \u201d Ms. Antonova told the Los Angeles Times in 2003. \u201cI said that we will put on this exhibition, and we won\u2019t need a dead body.\u201d When the show opened, she said, people \u201cpoured here to see their own artists, our own national art, which for decades they had been denied.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAnother category of artwork that spent decades in storage at the Pushkin and in other repositories \u2014 although for different reasons \u2014 were the thousands of works of art taken from Germany by the Soviet Army in the final days of World War II. For years, Soviet officials and museum administrators, Ms. Antonova among them, denied knowledge of their existence.\n\nIn the 1990s, when the \u201ctrophy art\u201d was revealed and eventually exhibited \u2014 prompting protests from the German government \u2014 Ms. Antonova steadfastly defended its place in Russia. The works were a form of reparations, she argued, for the innumerable works Germany had destroyed or stolen from the Soviet Union during the war.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cTo be entirely clear, the issue of trophy art is primarily one of an ethical nature,\u201d she told Der Spiegel. \u201cIt has to do with moral and not so much financial compensation for Russia. One cannot simply invade a country, destroy its museums and try to stamp out the roots of its culture, as the Germans did. This is a historic lesson for the entire world.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nA centerpiece of the disputed artwork was a trove of gold treasures from ancient Troy discovered by Heinrich Schliemann, an amateur German archaeologist, in the late 19th century. They were hidden at the Berlin Zoo at the end of World War II, discovered there by the Soviets, and eventually secreted away in repositories of the Pushkin. Ms. Antonova displayed the collection in 1996 in an exhibit that attracted international attention, and controversy.\n\nIf the Soviets had erred, she said, they had done so in not exhibiting the works earlier.\n\n\u201cIt was one of the stupidities of that period,\u201d she told the New York Times in 2002. \u201cIn 1945, after the war, everyone knew that some things came to the museum, but nobody was really working on them. It was stupid because we should have from the very first said that it belongs to Russia, because it was compensation for the enormous, unbelievable damage done to our country. Everything should have been put on display right away.\u201d\n\nIrina Alexandrovna Antonova was born in Moscow on March 20, 1922. Her father was a diplomat at the Soviet Embassy in Berlin, where the family resided from 1929 to 1933.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMs. Antonova had recently finished her first year at university when Germany invaded Russia in 1941 and worked at an ammunition factory and as a nurse at a military hospital during the war.\n\n\u201cDuring my first operation, I had to hold a leg while the surgeon amputated it,\u201d she told Der Spiegel. \u201cSuddenly I was holding it in my hand. I was shocked.\u201d\n\nShe studied art history at Moscow State University, graduating in 1945. The experience of working at the Pushkin, where the reproductions of her university textbooks were replaced by genuine works of art, exhilarated her.\n\nAccording to several accounts, as a young museum employee, she helped unload or catalogue early deliveries of trophy art from Germany.\n\nAD\n\nDespite the suffering that Russians endured under communism, Ms. Antonova told Der Spiegel in 2012 that \u201cperhaps I\u2019m going to disappoint you now, but I haven\u2019t lost faith in socialism to this day. It\u2019s obvious that Stalin was a tyrant. We chose the wrong path to socialism in the Soviet Union. But that doesn\u2019t mean that the idea is worthless.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nIn the final period of her tenure of director at the Pushkin, she publicly called on Russian President Vladimir Putin to rebuild a state museum of Western art that was destroyed under Stalin and whose holdings had been split between the Pushkin and the Hermitage. The decision not to rebuild the museum, she argued, amounted to adherence to \u201ca decree of Stalin.\u201d\n\nHer appeal, which the Hermitage opposed, sparked a contretemps that by some accounts contributed to her departure as director. She was 91 at the time.\n\nReflecting on her longevity at the museum, she liked to joke that she had one husband and one job her entire life. Survivors include a son, Boris, who according to the Art Newspaper was severely disabled.\n\nAlso reflecting on her longevity, she told Der Spiegel that \u201cI serve art.\u201d\n\n\u201cPoliticians come and go,\u201d she said, \u201cbut art is eternal.\u201d"}, {"link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/us-visas-china-communist-trump/2020/12/03/bf6694ea-3551-11eb-9699-00d311f13d2d_story.html?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=wp_world", "published": "2020-12-03T15:41:00", "title": "Trump restricts U.S. visas for Chinese Communist Party members and families", "text": "The restrictions would limit visas for party members and their relatives to a single entry, with the visa duration lasting one month.

Communist Party membership is not explicitly required but is often a de facto requisite for career advancement to top positions in China from the government to most major industries and academia. Many rank-and-file corporate employees and low-level civil servants are also dues-paying members.\n\nAD\n\nEven in the relatively liberal technology sector, top executives such as Alibaba co-founder Jack Ma are often party members and would normally travel to the United States multiple times a year. In Beijing and Shanghai, stories abound of the elite frequenting their California vacation homes or sending their children to East Coast boarding schools.\n\nThis week, ministry spokeswoman Hua accused officials at U.S. ports of harassing Chinese airline and shipping crews to ascertain whether they hold Communist Party membership.\n\nThe party began receding from everyday life after China turned toward economic liberalization in the 1980s. But it has made a comeback in recent years under current leader Xi Jinping, who has sought to root out corruption, attract younger members and return the party to its central role in Chinese society in the Marxist-Leninist tradition.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cGovernment, the military, society and schools, north, south, east, and west \u2014 the party leads everything,\u201d Xi said in 2017 in a political document outlining his thinking, known as \u201cXi Jinping Thought.\u201d\n\nAs the U.S.-China confrontation heightened this year, senior Trump administration officials, including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and deputy national security adviser Matthew Pottinger, delivered speeches that warned about the party\u2019s surging influence in China and abroad, while drawing a distinction between the party and the general Chinese population.\n\nThe rules curtailing travel for party members come after a year when the two governments have been at loggerheads over visas as well as trade, technology, covid-19 and a raft of other issues.\n\nAD\n\nIn September, the State Department canceled visas for 1,000 Chinese graduate students working in sensitive fields. U.S. officials said at the time they continued to welcome legitimate Chinese students \u201cwho do not further the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s goal of military dominance.\u201d The Chinese government denounced the move as \u201coutright political persecution and racial discrimination.\u201d\n\nAD"}, {"link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2020/07/16/coronavirus-pandemic-cities-reopening/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=wp_world", "published": "2020-11-20T17:43:07", "title": "What\u2019s reopened and what\u2019s still restricted in 16 cities around the world", "text": "Finally, some hope: promising tests on vaccines that could soon join the fight against the pandemic.

Prosecutors alleged that Huawei and Meng deceived the banks into clearing millions of dollars in transactions with Skycom in violation of U.S. sanctions prohibiting business dealings with Iran.\n\nMeng, the daughter of company founder Ren Zhengfei, has been sequestered in a multimillion-dollar mansion in Vancouver since then.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe talks, which were first reported by the Wall Street Journal, have not advanced to the point where an offer or deal is on the table, according to the people familiar with the matter.\n\nThe Justice Department declined to comment. Reid Weingarten, a lawyer for Meng, also declined to comment.\n\nMeng was indicted along with Huawei and two affiliates after a long-running Justice Department investigation. The charges were announced in January 2019 as China and the United States were locked in an economic impasse over President Trump\u2019s demands for a trade deal. They came, too, as Washington adopted a more confrontational tone with Beijing, which it sees as a competitor in economic and national security terms.\n\nAD\n\nHuawei has long been accused of posing a national security risk, with both Republican and Democratic lawmakers alleging that the Chinese government could force it to use its telecommunications gear for espionage purposes. Huawei has denied the allegations. But the Trump administration has mounted a vigorous and increasingly successful effort to persuade European and other allies to forgo using Huawei gear in their advanced wireless networks.\n\nAD\n\nMeng is in the midst of extradition proceedings that have also elevated tensions between Ottawa and Beijing.\n\nTen days after Canada arrested Meng in Vancouver at the behest of U.S. officials seeking her extradition, China detained two Canadians, former diplomat Michael Kovrig and businessman Michael Spavor, and charged them with breaching state secrets laws in a move widely seen as retaliation. China also put two Canadians on death row and blocked some agricultural imports from Canada, including canola seed.\n\nAD\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who is caught between his country\u2019s two largest trading partners, has faced calls, including from an ex-Supreme Court justice and several former foreign ministers, to drop the extradition case against Meng in hopes that it will spur China to release the two Canadians.\n\nAD\n\nBut he has rejected the calls, describing Meng\u2019s extradition case as a law enforcement matter that will be settled by a justice system whose independence from political intervention is \u201cdeeply dear to Canadians.\u201d\n\nMeng lost her first legal bid to end the extradition process in May, when a Canadian court ruled that the offenses alleged in charges the United States has filed against her are also crimes in Canada \u2014 a key legal test under extradition law in Canada.\n\nAD\n\nHer Canadian lawyers will next try to get the case dismissed in February, when they are expected to argue that her rights were violated when she was arrested at a Vancouver airport.

A few days after the meeting, they were rounded up by Egyptian security forces over a week-long period and charged with \u201cjoining a terrorist organization\u201d and \u201cusing social media accounts to spread false information.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSuch charges, often used by Egypt\u2019s regime against human rights advocates, typically result in months, even years, in pretrial detention or jail. And there are numerous cases where even after a release order, detainees are held for days. Yet on Thursday, the three men were released from Cairo\u2019s notorious Tora Prison instead of being taken to a local police station for processing, a move even EIPR said was \u201cunusual.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was a very quick and clean release, which is unprecedented,\u201d Omran said. \u201cThere was a lot of international pressure. \u2026 It worked.\u201d\n\nFew arrests have sparked the global outrage that followed the detention of the EIPR employees. The United Nations, France and other governments publicly denounced the arrests. Antony Blinken, President-elect Joe Biden\u2019s nominee for secretary of state, declared in a tweet that \u201cmeeting with foreign diplomats is not a crime. Nor is peacefully advocating for human rights.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOn social media, a petition campaign with the hashtags #FreeEIPRstaff and #FreeKarimEnnarah went viral, spearheaded by Ennarah\u2019s British wife, Jess Kelly. It prompted Hollywood celebrities such as Scarlett Johansson and Emma Thompson to post videos of themselves on YouTube urging the release of the EIPR staffers. In Egypt, EIPR remained vocal and defiant.\n\nOn Thursday night, after the three men took cabs from the prison to their homes, one of the group\u2019s leaders publicly noted that the global outcry played a significant role in convincing the regime to release his colleagues.\n\n\u201cI can confirm my friends and EIPR colleague, Gasser, Basheer and Karim have been released and are home which I guess means we (and you) managed to #FreeEIPRstaff,\u201d tweeted Hossam Bahgat, the organization\u2019s founder.\n\nAD\n\nBahgat, despite being under a travel ban and asset freeze imposed by the Sissi government, returned to take the helm last month after Abdel-Razek, its executive director, was taken into custody. Placed in a cold cell, he was initially denied warm clothing and a mattress, among other ill treatment, said Amnesty International.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThis is an important reminder that robust pressure can work & Egypt\u2019s partners have leverage when they coordinate efforts & remain consistent in their demands,\u201d tweeted Timothy Kaldas, an Egypt analyst at the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy. \u201cLet\u2019s hope these innocent human rights defenders don\u2019t carry any residual punishments like travel bans.\u201d\n\nBut the organization and the trio could still face problems in the weeks ahead. There is an ongoing investigation into the charges against them and a possible trial for involvement in terrorist activities, charges widely denounced by watchdog groups and Western diplomats as bogus. The men could not only be banned from traveling, but have their assets frozen, actions often taken by the government to undermine and control human rights advocates.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know the status of the case,\u201d Omran said.\n\nAD\n\nBahgat himself is under more scrutiny for his outspokenness and defiance of the regime.

It seemed like a reminder from Iranian hard-liners that Fakhrizadeh was really one of theirs.\n\nThe dueling messages underscore the intense debate that Fakhrizadeh\u2019s death \u2014 in a brazen daylight ambush Friday east of the capital, Tehran \u2014 has stirred in his country, including over who was responsible for the security lapses implicated in the killing and its consequences. Most urgent is a dispute over how best Iran should respond \u2014 with restraint, fury or something in between.\n\nArguments over Fakhrizadeh are being wielded like cudgels by conservatives and reformists, squaring off in \u201cthe currently very contentious politics of Iran,\u201d said Ali Reza Eshraghi, a visiting scholar at the Center for Middle East and Islamic Studies at the University of North Carolina.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe outcome of these debates could have profound implications for the Biden administration, which hopes to renew nuclear negotiations after four years of President Trump\u2019s \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d campaign against Tehran.\n\nIran\u2019s conservative-dominated parliament responded to the \u00adkilling by passing legislation Wednesday to immediately increase uranium enrichment to levels well above those allowed under the nuclear deal, and to suspend United Nations nuclear inspections if oil and banking sanctions on Iran are not lifted by early February. These steps would probably complicate President-elect Biden\u2019s ambitions to reengage with Iran.\n\nRouhani pushed back: \u201cLet\u2019s allow the ones who have more than 20 years of experience in diplomacy and have defeated the U.S. many times in the past three years to proceed with care and patience,\u201d he said Thursday during a ceremony at the Energy Ministry.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIt remains unclear whether Iran\u2019s leadership will carry out the plan come the February deadline. Even so, Tehran is likely to seek greater concessions from the West in any renewed nuclear negotiations, using Fakhrizadeh\u2019s assassination \u2014 a fresh grievance \u2014 as leverage, analysts said.\n\nThe killing \u2014 widely attributed to Israel and seen among Iranians as a flagrant national insult \u2014 could also have consequences for a public battered by a year of extraordinary hardships, including the most severe coronavirus outbreak in the Middle East and an economic crisis made worse by a suffocating regime of Western sanctions. In recent days, people have been bracing for further state repression of dissent, \u201cwith an excuse of having to be united against a foreign invasive power,\u201d said Amir, a 30-year-old university student studying philosophy in Tehran, who spoke on the condition that only his first name be used out of fear for his security.\n\nFakhrizadeh was a key figure in Iran\u2019s disbanded nuclear weapons program and one of Iran\u2019s best-guarded officials. The fatal ambush is widely seen as the latest in a string of grave lapses by Iran\u2019s security and intelligence services, including the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). The year began with a U.S. drone strike in Baghdad that killed a top IRGC commander, Maj. Gen. Qasem Soleimani, and days later Iranian security forces mistakenly shot down a Ukrainian passenger jet, killing all 176 people aboard. In July, a fire broke out at a nuclear facility that Iranian authorities blamed on \u201csabotage.\u201d Then in August, Israeli agents acting on behalf of the United States assassinated a senior al-Qaeda official in Tehran.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAfter Fakhrizadeh\u2019s death, Iranian officials sought to deflect responsibility for security failures. \u201cThere is a kind of blame game going around between the government intelligence ministry and IRGC intelligence ministry,\u201d two competing parts of Iran's bifurcated political system, said Ellie Geranmayeh, deputy director of Middle East and North Africa programs at the European Council on Foreign Relations.\n\nAs news of the ambush spread, Iranian media outlets, based on eyewitnesses, reported that up to 12 perpetrators could have been involved and then escaped. By Monday, officials were pushing a new narrative seemingly intended to save face: The attack was \u201ca very complicated assassination that was carried out remotely with electronic devices,\u201d Ali Shamkhani, secretary of the Supreme National Security Council of Iran, told state television, \u00adaccording to the Reuters news agency.\n\nThe killing has \u201cincreased the heat from the more conservative end\u201d of Iran\u2019s political system on Rouhani, who represents a camp more open to nuclear negotiations with Western powers. \u201cThere is a lot of backlash currently in Iran about the need to retaliate, the need to ramp up the nuclear energy program,\u201d said Narges Bajoghli, an Iran expert at the School of Advanced International Studies at Johns Hopkins University.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe parliamentary vote to increase nuclear enrichment and suspend U.N. inspections is the clearest shot yet fired by conservatives.\n\nThe legislation was finalized after a back-and-forth with the Guardian Council, which vets such proposals, and gives European countries two months to relieve sanctions and provide access to international banking systems. That is a challenging timeline with President Trump still in office until January.\n\nRouhani\u2019s government is technically obliged to implement the legislation. But Iran\u2019s nuclear file is under the authority of the Supreme National Security Council, a body made up of military and political leaders that ultimately reflects the preferences of Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the country\u2019s supreme leader. Come February, the council will decide whether to proceed with the plan, said Geranmayeh. For now, the legislation remains symbolic, a show of strength that ramps up pressure on Rouhani\u2019s camp.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEither way, the legislation and the attention it received were \u201cindicative of the wider debate that\u2019s going on\u201d over whether the assassination provided further leverage Iran could use in its negotiations with the United States, Bajoghli said.\n\nNone of Iran\u2019s most influential political factions argued against negotiations with the West, which could bring an end to crippling U.S. sanctions imposed after the Trump administration unilaterally walked away from the 2015 nuclear agreement, said Geranmayeh. But there was \u201cconsiderable disagreement whether Iran under Rouhani . . . risks being duped again by America,\u201d she said.\n\nThe assassination of Fakhrizadeh now threatens to further widen the gap between Iran and the United States, said Afshon Ostovar, an associate professor of national security affairs at the U.S. Naval Postgraduate School.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThere is a growing consensus in the United States that issues apart from Iran\u2019s nuclear program \u2014 such as its ballistic missile development and support for proxy militias elsewhere in the region \u2014 may need to be part of any future agreement. On the other side, Iran believes that any deal \u201cneeds to be weaker and come with more inducements than the first one,\u201d he said.\n\nWith Iran scheduled to hold a presidential election this spring, some analysts predict that hard-line factions could prevail and consolidate their grip on power, further complicating Biden\u2019s hopes for reviving diplomacy with Tehran. \u201cI think some windows of opportunities are closing,\u201d Eshraghi said.\n\nWhile it could be easier for the Biden administration to negotiate with reformists, a victory by the conservatives would not necessarily bring diplomacy to a halt. A more hard-line government in Iran \u201cmight allow for a slower rapprochement \u2014 but at the same time, one that might last longer,\u201d Eshraghi said.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThere has been a lot of talk inside Iran that Rouhani should not be in charge of these negotiations \u2014 it\u2019s a lame-duck administration\u201d \u2014 and that negotiations be handled by the Supreme National Security Council instead, he said.\n\nOne wild card is the possibility that the Trump administration or allies such as Israel could carry out another attack in the coming weeks, perhaps to preempt a new diplomatic push by the Biden team.\n\n\u201cSo far, and I think that this is going to continue to be the case, the Iranian establishment all across the board has determined that they will continue with \u2018maximum restraint,\u2019 as they call it,\u201d Bajoghli said.\n\nOther analysts are not so sure.\n\nAD\n\nIn the days before Fakhrizadeh\u2019s killing, a prisoner swap raised hopes for an easing of international tensions. Iran had freed an imprisoned Australian academic, apparently in exchange for three Iranian operatives who had been jailed in Thailand since 2012 over a botched plot to kill Israeli diplomats.\n\nAD\n\nThose operatives had been on a mission to retaliate for Israel\u2019s earlier assassinations of nuclear scientists, but had failed. Their return to Iran, to a heroes\u2019 welcome, was viewed as an achievement by Iran\u2019s security and intelligence agencies, and \u201chad kind of closed that circle of the shadow war against the nuclear program,\u201d Ostovar said.\n\nFakhrizadeh\u2019s killing may have given Iran a new score to settle.\n\n\u201cHow does Iran handle this? What do they do? There is no way you want it to continue happening,\u201d he said."}, {"link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2020/12/03/namibia-election-adolf-hitler-uunona/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=wp_world", "published": "2020-12-03T17:33:08", "title": "", "text": ""}, {"link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2020/12/03/la-bsqueda-de-los-desaparecidos-apunta-algunos-de-los-secretos-ms-oscuros-de-mxico/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=wp_world", "published": "2020-12-03T15:42:34", "title": "La b\u00fasqueda de los desaparecidos apunta a algunos de los secretos m\u00e1s oscuros de M\u00e9xico", "text": "Mary Beth Sheridan is a correspondent covering Mexico and Central America for The Washington Post.

They\u2019d hacked them to pieces and roasted them until the bones exploded. The remains were dumped in shallow, unmarked graves.\n\nNow, 12 miles from the NAFTA boomtown of Torre\u00f3n, the land was dotted with tiny bone fragments. Quintana, a 41-year-old lawyer in a pink scarf, stared as a pebble crumbled in her hand. \u201cYou don\u2019t know if that\u2019s a person disintegrating,\u201d she said later.\n\nMore than 79,000 people have disappeared in Mexico, most of them since 2006. It\u2019s the worst crisis of the disappeared in Latin America since the Cold War, when military-backed governments kidnapped and secretly killed their leftist opponents \u2014 an estimated 45,000 in Guatemala, up to 30,000 in Argentina, as many as 3,400 in Chile. And Mexico\u2019s numbers keep rising. Last year saw a record. Mexicans are uncovering two clandestine graves a day, on average.\n\nMexico\u2019s disappeared since 2006\n\nFor the first time, the federal government has committed to a serious effort to find the missing. Quintana is in charge. President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, a longtime leftist, named her as part of a sweeping commitment to elevate human rights in a country still emerging from its authoritarian past.\n\nBut Mexico\u2019s new wave of disappearances is more baffling, more complex than what happened during Latin America\u2019s dirty wars of the 1970s and 1980s. It coincides with the drug war and the country\u2019s troubled transition to democracy.\n\nThe culprits are sometimes the armed forces, but more commonly they\u2019re the country\u2019s drug cartels, often in league with corrupt police. The sheer number of the disappeared reflects a collapse of order in America\u2019s neighbor, with a proliferating number of crime groups warring over territory.\n\nA mass grave near Torre\u00f3n is excavated on Dec. 17. Volunteers at the site separate fragments of human bones from rocks and dirt. A federal police officer guards the excavation site. (Photos by Alejandro Cegarra for The Washington Post)\n\nIn February 2019, Quintana walked into her new office at the National Search Commission. There were a dozen desks and a few chairs. The commission had been established a year earlier, but barely funded. Initially, she paid the WiFi bill out of her own pocket.\n\nShe was a respected lawyer, but human rights activists had their doubts. Quintana had embarked on \u201cthe most impossible job in the country,\u201d one said. She would receive a $22 million budget for her first year \u2014 significant but hardly enough. She\u2019d have to rely on a corrupt, underfunded justice system for help in exhuming and identifying the bodies. She had no prosecutorial power.\n\nStill, Quintana saw reasons for hope. Her boss at the powerful Government Ministry, Alejandro Encinas, was one of L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s closest allies. The president had vowed to solve Mexico\u2019s most notorious case of the disappeared: 43 college students who had vanished years earlier. On taking office in 2018, L\u00f3pez Obrador named a gender-balanced cabinet and pledged more attention to the poor and Indigenous. He\u2019d even written a book defending migrants \u2014 and called it \u201cListen Up, Trump.\u201d\n\n[Disappearances in Mexico rose during L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s first year]\n\n\u201cMany people think human rights defenders should always be in opposition to the government,\u201d Quintana said. \u201cI\u2019d say there are moments in which it\u2019s necessary \u2014 there is no other option \u2014 but to be in the government.\u201d\n\nTen months into the job, though, she was starting to realize the limits of government power. Nowhere was that more true than in the desert outside Torre\u00f3n, where on that chilly morning last December, she was exploring a field sprinkled with human remains the size of peppercorns.\n\nQuintana had roared up with six truckloads of federal police and soldiers. Just a day earlier, men peering through binoculars had been seen driving slowly past the graves. \u201cThey surveil us, they threaten us,\u201d said Silvia Ortiz, the leader of a group of mothers who found the graves while searching for their missing children.\n\nGroups such as Ortiz\u2019s were combing sites like this all over the country, largely on their own. They weren\u2019t particularly impressed by Quintana\u2019s Harvard law degree. \u201cWhat if she\u2019s the kind of woman who just sits behind a desk?\u201d Ortiz recalled thinking when she first heard of the commissioner.\n\nNow the bureaucrat was here, her hiking boots sinking into the soft dirt, a floppy hat jammed over her short gray hair. She fired questions at Ortiz and a state forensic expert.\n\nHow long had they been digging here? (Four years). How much help had they received from the government? (Not much). How many bodies were in each grave? (Up to 10 pounds of pebbles \u2014 around three humans). Quintana surveyed the barren land. Here, the narcos didn\u2019t just disappear people but exterminated them. It would be impossible to identify many of the remains.\n\nOrtiz looked at her. \u201cThere are 13 sites like this, my dear.\u201d\n\nA cross hangs on a photograph of Fanny S\u00e1nchez, who disappeared in Torre\u00f3n in 2004. Her mother, Silvia Ortiz, leads a group of relatives of the disappeared who search for hidden graves. (Alejandro Cegarra for The Washington Post)\n\nMexico\u2019s first crisis of the disappeared was in the 1970s, when security forces abducted and killed more than 1,000 leftist insurgents and their supporters. It was a smaller-scale version of the kidnappings carried out by dictatorships in places such as Argentina and Guatemala. Disappearances became known as a unique kind of evil, denying families closure, leaving them forever tortured by the mystery of their loved ones\u2019 fates.\n\nWhen disappearances began to resurge here in recent years, many suspected the security forces. In 2006, then-President Felipe Calder\u00f3n militarized the war on drugs, deploying the army and marines to fight the cartels. Complaints of human rights abuses soared.\n\n[U.S. judge drops drug charges against former Mexican defense minister]\n\nBut drug traffickers, too, were abducting people. By the time Quintana became commissioner, it was obvious that they often worked closely with corrupt officials. Nowhere was that clearer than in the case of the 43 students from the southern town of Ayotzinapa, who went missing in 2014, possibly after stumbling onto a heroin-trafficking operation. A special prosecutor has linked local and federal police, military officers and even a former top justice official to the disappearances.\n\nHow did things get this bad? It\u2019s easy to blame the well-armed criminal gangs. The truth is more complicated. In 2000, Mexicans voted to end seven decades of authoritarian, one-party rule. But the young democracy failed to build a professional justice system, with well-trained and well-equipped police and prosecutors. Today, only around 1 percent of crimes are reported and solved. \u201cThe use of violence is less regulated than it was before,\u201d said Romain Le Cour Grandmaison, the co-founder of Noria Research, which studies conflict. \u201cMany more people are using violence.\u201d\n\nIt was the mothers who finally forced officials to take action on the disappeared. They held demonstrations around the country, waving poster-size photos of their missing children. Their pressure led to the creation of the search commission, at the end of President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s administration.\n\nThe first commissioner served for only a few months. When Quintana arrived early last year, there was barely any staff.\n\nBut six weeks later, there she was at the National Palace, sitting on a stage behind L\u00f3pez Obrador, blinking at the TV lights, as he announced an unprecedented effort to find the disappeared. \u201cThere is no budget limit, no financial ceiling,\u201d he declared. The auditorium erupted in applause.\n\nWhen Quintana first arrived at the commission, it had just a handful of employees. (Alejandro Cegarra for The Washington Post)\n\nQuintana knew there was no such thing in government as an unlimited budget. Still, she was optimistic. \u201cFor the first time, maybe in a limited manner, the state, as a state, is trying to give a response,\u201d she said.\n\nQuintana came by her idealism naturally. Her father grew up poor; he put himself through law school by swabbing floors. The law was his ticket to a middle-class life, but it was something more. \u201cBeing a lawyer means nothing less than maintaining the light of the ideals of Justice,\u201d he wrote in a three-page letter to his daughter.\n\nQuintana, too, was a striver. She arrived at Harvard in 2007 with a pile of grants and $1,500 in the bank. When she realized she didn\u2019t know legal terms in English, she binge-watched \u201cLaw and Order.\u201d Later, as a prosecutor at the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights in Washington, she represented victims of horrific abuses \u2014 disappearances, massacres, torture. She would absorb their pain and use it as \u201ca source of energy,\u201d said Silvia Serrano, a Colombian colleague. The young attorneys would stay up all night prepping before a big case, fueled by coffee and Red Bull. \u201cI never saw her tired,\u201d Serrano said.\n\nBy 2013, Quintana had a husband and a chubby-cheeked little girl and a cozy basement apartment near Washington National Cathedral. But the family decided to move to Mexico. Quintana\u2019s father had Alzheimer\u2019s. She felt a debt to Mexico. \u201cWe always had this feeling we were not doing enough for our countries,\u201d Serrano said.\n\nOne of Quintana\u2019s first priorities was to figure out exactly who was missing.\n\nRemains of the disappeared are kept in crypts at the edge of a graveyard in Zacatecas state. Reports on those who are missing sit on a bookshelf at the Zacatecas Institute of Forensic Sciences. Remains that have been found at clandestine gravesites are usually taken to the institute for analysis, cataloguing and storage. (Photos by Luis Antonio Rojas for The Washington Post)\n\nThe search commission had 40,000 names of the disappeared in a crazy quilt of Excel documents and Word files, replete with duplications and typos. Quintana hired a dozen people \u2014 programmers, systems analysts, lawyers \u2014 to consolidate and update the material. They called state prosecutors\u2019 offices for the latest figures.\n\nThe trouble was, many wouldn\u2019t send the information. In some cases, their computer systems didn\u2019t talk to the federal government\u2019s. In others, their records were just a mess. In the central state of Guanajuato \u2014 one of Mexico\u2019s most violent \u2014 a justice official told lawmakers last year there had been only 11 cases of forced disappearance. In reality, more than 1,000 people were missing, according to an investigation published this year by the citizens group Data C\u00edvica \u2014 but they\u2019d apparently been misclassified.\n\nIn January, two weeks after her trip to Torre\u00f3n, Quintana stepped up to a lectern in a shabby beige government auditorium in downtown Mexico City. The commission had come up with a more accurate toll of the disappeared: 61,637. \u201cThese are data of horror,\u201d she said at the news conference. But it was still an undercount. Many people were too afraid to file complaints. And despite Quintana\u2019s pleading, nearly one-third of Mexico\u2019s 32 states still hadn\u2019t turned over their figures \u2014 including Guanajuato.\n\nTime and again, Quintana\u2019s small office clashed with Mexico\u2019s sprawling justice system. Her team could help find clandestine graves and remove remains, but because these were technically crime scenes, someone from the prosecutor\u2019s office had to be present. The prosecutors\u2019 offices, which had most of the government\u2019s forensic experts and oversaw the identification of bodies, were supposed to be her partners. But some of them were riddled with corruption. Others were grossly understaffed. In one state, Quintana found only three lawyers assigned to handle 900 disappearances \u2014 and process the graves that continued to be discovered.\n\nThe dysfunction of the bureaucracy was staggering. Mexico had become so violent, so awash in bodies, that medical examiners ran out of space. In 2018, authorities in Jalisco state resorted to loading excess corpses into a refrigerated truck that was moved from town to town.\n\n[Mexico\u2019s Jalisco New Generation Cartel blazes a bloody trail in rise to power]\n\nThat caused a national scandal. But in fact, state medical examiners had been disposing of bodies for years without conducting autopsies or taking DNA samples. Quintana and other officials crunched the numbers. There were something like 37,000 such corpses. It hit her: At least some of the disappeared weren\u2019t disappeared at all. They were misplaced. By the government itself.\n\n\u201cWhere are they?\u201d she asked one day in her office, scrawling the number on a legal pad and stabbing it with her pencil. \u201cCertainly in common graves. The question is, where?\u201d\n\nThe work was often excruciating. There were the painful encounters with the mothers, who wanted their children back \u2014 now.\n\nFamily members of the disappeared have formed independent search groups to find their loved ones. (Luis Antonio Rojas for The Washington Post)\n\nThere was the bureaucratic indifference. \u201cIt affects you every day,\u201d Quintana said one evening as she sipped red wine in her simple, white-walled apartment.\n\nSometimes she couldn\u2019t sleep. She had to be careful about security \u2014 she no longer posted casually on Facebook or Twitter. \u201cYou protect the people close to you,\u201d she said. In her meetings with families, she never mentioned that she, too, was a mom. By this point, she and her husband had divorced; he\u2019d moved with their daughter back to the United States. Only a few colleagues knew why Quintana withdrew every night at 8, phone in hand. Hundreds of miles away, a little girl was going to bed.\n\nMore than a year into the job, Quintana had made some progress. Her commission had swelled to 89 employees. She\u2019d helped create government search committees in every state. In August 2020, Mexico recognized the authority of the United Nations to investigate disappearances, a step that was long anathema to the military. She used some of the commission\u2019s money to fund a center in the northern state of Coahuila to identify bodies. The U.S. Agency for International Development doubled its assistance with a $24 million, five-year grant to find the disappeared and combat torture.\n\nBut tensions were building with the attorney general\u2019s office. After months of work, Quintana\u2019s commission presented an ambitious master plan, known as a search protocol, that would give it access to information from across the Mexican government. Federal justice officials refused to sign off, citing concerns that investigations could be compromised.\n\nTo relatives of the victims, the dispute was disheartening.\n\n\u201cIf the two government bodies that can give us good results can\u2019t work together, what hope do we have of success in searching?\u201d asked Grace Fern\u00e1ndez, the leader of one such group.\n\nIt was just the latest sign of what human rights activists saw as a darkening picture.\n\nAmnesty International had criticized L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s first year in a report titled \u201cWhen words are not enough.\u201d The president had reversed himself on several fronts: expanding, rather than reducing, the power of the military to fight crime; dispatching the national guard to crack down on Central American migrants in response to pressure from the Trump administration. When Mexican women launched a nationwide strike in March to protest an alarming rise in femicides, he blamed the action in part on his political opposition.\n\nFamilies of the disappeared recognized that there had been advances in the search for their loved ones, but the effort fell well short of L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s promise to involve \u201call the institutions\u201d in resolving the problem. \u201cThere\u2019s not a strategy of state,\u201d Fern\u00e1ndez said.\n\nQuintana meets with local officials and relatives of the disappeared as they prepare to exhume a mass grave in October in the Guanajuato town of Salvatierra. (Mary Beth Sheridan/The Washington Post)\n\nQuintana wrapped a green scarf around her hair to ward off the cold and shoved her hands in the pockets of her jeans. Facing her was a circle of people, their faces covered by ski caps and kerchiefs with tiny slits for eyeholes. She\u2019d never seen such a terrified group of moms.\n\n\u201cWe know the security situation here is complicated,\u201d Quintana told them. \u201cIt was urgent to come and support you in any way we can.\u201d\n\nIt was 9:30 a.m. on a Tuesday in October and she was standing on a grassy lot just off a street lined with pastel-colored homes in the Guanajuato town of Salvatierra. For a week, her team had been digging in the fields here with the relatives of the disappeared. They\u2019d found 47 bodies. Within days, the total would grow to 69 \u2014 the biggest gravesite ever found in the state.\n\nUntil recently, the state prosecutor\u2019s office had denied the existence of mass graves. This was Guanajuato: an industrial juggernaut, home to GM, Volkswagen, Toyota and Honda plants; and a tourist magnet, with pretty Spanish colonial towns such as San Miguel de Allende. In recent years it had also become a battleground between the Jalisco New Generation and Santa Rosa de Lima cartels. But that was not the image the state wanted to project.\n\nThe site that morning was a swirl of activity: soldiers leashing their search dogs, civil-protection officials lugging medical kits. The prosecutor\u2019s office normally sent only four staffers to help the moms at suspected gravesites, they said. Now there were 25. That\u2019s what happened when Quintana came to town.\n\n\u201cIf it weren\u2019t for her, they wouldn\u2019t even have dug up that grave,\u201d said Conchita Sierra, one of the mothers. \u201cThey would have hidden it, as they hide others.\u201d\n\nState officials deny they\u2019ve ignored the problem. \u201cWe\u2019re going to do everything necessary so the people we find in this place are correctly identified,\u201d Zuce Hern\u00e1ndez, Guanajuato\u2019s prosecutor for human rights abuses, said at a news conference.\n\nSoldiers with dogs search for bodies at the mass grave in Salvatierra. (Mary Beth Sheridan/The Washington Post)\n\nAs 2020 neared an end, the count of people reported missing in Mexico had grown to more than 79,000. New names were being added to the list all the time. L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s administration had failed to rein in the country\u2019s barbaric violence. In the Salvatierra grave, some corpses were found embracing one another. \u201cWe came to the conclusion they were buried alive,\u201d Sierra said.\n\nJos\u00e9 Miguel Vivanco, the Americas director for Human Rights Watch, said Quintana \u201crepresents a clear and genuine commitment to do something for the victims\u201d of massive atrocities. But her mandate, he cautioned, is narrow. \u201cShe\u2019s searching for the whereabouts\u201d of missing people, he said. \u201cNot the truth about who killed them and why.\u201d\n\nIn a small way, Quintana was searching for that, too. She was trying to set up a unit within her commission to write the histories of the disappeared. To identify the patterns, the perpetrators in different regions. The justice system had an abysmal record of convictions: From 2006 to 2019, it opened 11,706 investigations of forced disappearances. Only 39 people were sentenced.\n\nQuintana hoped that someday her histories could serve as evidence for a judicial process, or a truth commission.\n\n\u201cMaybe it\u2019s not in a year or two,\u201d Quintana said. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s 10 or 20.\u201d\n\nIt was a Sunday, and she was back from Guanajuato, enjoying a rare moment of calm, having breakfast in a cafe with her partner, a Belgian human rights worker. October had been brutal: 69 bodies found in Guanajuato, more than 100 in Jalisco state. Progress, of a sort. But with so much impunity, so much institutional weakness, Mexico could be digging up bodies for decades.\n\nHer phone rang. Several of her employees were in Chihuahua state, battling a sandstorm as they investigated a mass grave. It looked like this would be a big one."}]}, "theonion": {"link": "http://www.theonion.com/", "articles": []}, "cbcnews": {"rss": "https://www.cbc.ca/rss/", "link": "https://www.cbc.ca/news", "articles": []}, "globalnews": {"rss": "https://globalnews.ca/pages/feeds/", "link": "https://globalnews.ca/", "articles": []}, "ctvnews": {"rss": "https://www.ctvnews.ca/more/rss-feeds-for-ctv-news", "link": "https://www.ctvnews.ca/", "articles": []}}}
